The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The first revelation is almost the consensus that these are the five verses of Surah Al -Alaq.Reconciliation of the cave, the thought of the cave, the thought of thinking and thinking that one day the angel came and what the angel came to bring, to which he said, "Akra was a thing that the wall is full of understanding.The Holy Prophet then said, "I will come for the third time again.After doing three times, then it is true of the delicious Lord of Akra Bismillah.It is true that my tradition is the first thing that came to the fore.If you say, it was not difficult to say that it was forty years old.Why did you not have children?There was a thing that was trapped.If you were to be trapped, it was actually the world that you used to say, there was a capacity of the Ban of Awakening and the Ban of Awakening, in which the angel came in his original.On which it was kept, you said, "I am not reading in the mood.Now you are having a connection with it.But then, who is also with the chest, three times, you say that the advertisement was created inside you, then you read it and I remind me that when I said that when I saw the other, it was effective." How did Hazrat Jamriel see how the same angel who came to the cave of haram, he was in his original form of national form, but there was a state of awakening.He was not a state of full awareness.On the way down or Muhammad or Mohammed came, and then you looked around the two mourners, then you saw some fear, then you would have been applied.He created a human being from something like a jog that was burned in the mercy of the mother.The beloved is the Almighty Allah, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) is taught the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) with the pen of the pen.From this revelation as I have said twelve, 25 and 26 are today.It was a matter of revelation, then the verses of Surah Moser became observers, or the Eva al -Mumdasir Qum Fa'anzar Warbak -Fakbir, from there, then started to say that you should read the grave of the Lord and the Lord of the Lord.We have read this jinn.Here are the verses coming here again here.This is the philosophy of the Hereafter.There is no human being on the slaughter of the Hereafter.If I put it on the language, you will go to the place.There will not be a scandal and if you eat a sink, you will die and you are forbidden as much as you do, it is not that the turning loose while the physical loose is open.Let me not be able to answer that if the solution is a solution to this whole case, then there is a moral decline in a society, then it is only Qayev and it will be believed in the Hereafter that everything will be answered.It will be the calculation that will earn any change in the particle.The third part was there, and the third part of Walid ibn Mughira is related.There was no unusual incident and once the Holy Prophet was in prostration.Lockery to leak out to leak out and leak out to leap to the jerk, leaving the ojadi les on the gorge to leak the yogw, leaving the oj -e -lads, leaving the yogurt.Locker, leak to the jerk, to leap to the jerk, to leap to the jerk, leaving the oj -e -legger to leap to the jerk, leaving the oj -e -lasi to the jerk.Lockery and leak out and leak out.
