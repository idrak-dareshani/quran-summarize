deal of attention here.The second half of Surah Al -Baqarah is a joint on the day within these twenty -two ricks.Before the day that God has given you, the day Adam will have no buying or any friendship, nor will any friendship be useful.The disbeliever is not a disbeliever who does not obey the command of Allah that religion is overwhelmed.It is striking to overcome it.There are some requirements of it.He has financial needs.He and Allah have given it power.He can spend it in it and he does not.Al -Kursi is also known as the name of the pearls and great flowers of great wisdom.In the case, Allah has collected it, but the details of it came in a verse, where the verse we have compiled is the first case for the Qur'an, and the second lesson is the verse, which is the case, which is the case.Surah Akhlas will become four in it, but it has given the Qur'an the Qur'an with the Holy Qur'an.Four days were cut in two requests.No precaution will come forward.Surah Willah Na'am cannot be attributed to it.But with his permission, this place is now coming.There is no healing in Surah Al -Baqara after the first time of the Catigarical Daniel, there is no healing.There is no healing here.Who is very glory.Otherwise, the second verse of Surah al -Baqarah is the second verse of the Surah al -Baqarah, the second verse of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).The second verse of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) is the second verse of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Shafat walaa ham yunsarun and now it has come in the

of them and what we are in the world usually recommends, saying that I know that person is better as it is, or as some fax on the file has come, it is a big baCing.They are behind and they cannot do

Allah.Are?The water is deaf in the limits of the river, but when it comes out of its limits, what is the worry of the river?So, both of them are denying the tahuat who say disbelief with Tahutat and then believe in Allah, even the friendship of Allah with the enemies of Allah, and the claim of loyalty to Allah is not the case.This is the hypocrisy.The person who has done this work, and the faith of Allah, he has taken a joke in Allah, so it is understood that if a person does not fall on a plane in a ship, he does not even fall into his hands.Then he was engraved with his weight, but the engraving of the engraving has put his hand on a great combination, that is, denying the taghut and believing in Allah.He has a lot of fun.That is why a Hadith comes in a Hadith.This with the Samo

Nimrod.The birth of Abbasi was also the city of Aram, which was the city of Babeloni, Iraq and there was a kingdom of Nimrod, as Pharaoh had claimed in Egypt, and of his God, and it is a political kingdom.It is not that we have created the world.It is in the hands of Allah to declare a person forbidden to make a person lawful.The person who has taken the responsibility of the law has taken the power of the righteous.He is the same as the law of Allah.He is the martyr.He is the Nimrod.And one of the same flew the same and said to one, "Look, I kept it alive and whom I wanted to do, and Ibrahim saw that it was descended on the Hajjat, so the answer was to the Almighty Allah, who would have cheated him." Bashishmus Ibrahim said, "Allah pulls the sun out of the east, if you are the plaintiff of God, then from the west to the west, there was no answer to it.Yahid al -Qa'a'am al -Zu'awalimin and Allah

goat, and took the prisoner for a hundred years.He has been in Qaiti Bhatti for a hundred years.It is a soul.There was no man.There was no human being.No one was left safe.They were present and they died on the same thing, and the coffin was also Sakina.How can it revive after being destroyed and ruined?How can it be revived?How can people come back and settled in it so much destruction is not so devastating no two hach ​​no security.The question of how long have you been here?Hazrat Azir is here because the Renirsation that has happened in history Bin Israel is the basis of his origin.It is

blessings of Allaah be upon him).It was fully aware that I got to be sure that Allah is capable of every child, that is, he can resettle the settlement which was well -known, how it will be settled now.That was the enemy of Iraq after the Palestine Iraq, Kheesh attacked Babylon and the enemy's enemy friend, then allowed the youngsters to be given from your daughter.You go back to your city, so they went and then they went there again and again.They say that they were destroyed by the Taix Roman general in the seventy -seventy -seven, which has been destroyed so far.The Ka'bah is a landslide from the nineteen -seventy -seven Morses.The thing is and the thing is ready.Someday there will be an explosion.There will be a bomb that will be planted somewhere.It will be reported that someone has left a filtract as a filtate went to the Masjidi on Khalil and the sparrow Muslims themselves committed suicide, and the doctor would go to the Goldstine as if he would go to Goldstin.The matter is now fallen, then Brother, let us say let us build a Ram temple.Which is a great pillow, so don't you want to believe?Faith has also been believed.I believe that I want to assure the assurance of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).Adult does not remain, but that faith is also shadowed.Showed that Abraham, the land of heaven and the land, which is our government, which is a secret government that is a state of Kaumak, is all his personnel.We have witnessed that the Holy Prophet was taken to the Holy Prophet, because every thing that he himself became a furnace and the believer.يَتْمَيِنَّ

ahead of it.For the sake of the Almighty, there is a means of abusing the goods, the poor, the poor, the needy, the widows for them, ie, these are the ingredients of your society.Surrounding for infidelity is for him, and the proximity is for him for him to abolish the wealth of the religion of Allah in the way of Allah's wealth.If the requirements and needs of the Brahley can be fulfilled, then what will be surfed in this work is the proximity of Allah or Allah to Hussein here.The problem of infidelity is Allah for the sake of Allah, for the sake of Allah.The path is Sabil Allah, but that is the meaning of Allah, which is the meaning of Allah.The greater the religion is the religion of today.In the method of Allah, whoever spends his wealth for his religion, will increase his wealth, Allaah will give them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "I asked you to give me any way, but Allah Almighty

come in enthusiasm and grind you, he can do a new humor.By giving up and giving any honor, the GU Faqu Malo Re -Adnas is like a person who is giving his bar to the people who are giving them to the people.It is a matter of fact that he does not really believe in Allah and on the day of Riyadh and on the end of the day, as the hadeeth has repeatedly shared, the only one who has shown it to show that the people who have shown it to show that the people who have shown it to be shy.If he gave charity, he performed the polytheism, so his example was a bit of a balloon.If a little dirt was frozen, then if a little bit of clay was over on a chin, you put a seed there.The crop is also the rock that is the rock that came from inside, that is, everything went out.In mathematics, it also means that the wealth was given and nothing happened.And where did Allah have no question of any stranger and the question of any stranger.Such disbelievers do not guide such mangoes.Along with this, the example for him is also an example for him, and the example of those who spend their wealth for the pleasure of Allah, and the example of those who spend their wealth for the pleasure of Allah.With the maturity of my self and the maturity of my priest, with the maturity of my own self, the example of this is the burden of this garden, which is at a height, as I did, as I had the idea of ​​a palm, which I had to do with it.Erigation is happening.From this, the Qadianis have taken the word Rabuah and their city.In Pakistan, even if it comes to this garden, there will be a rainfall

did this.I made the foundation.Whether everyone was burned because he did not have a luxury in it.There was a lack in it.There was a sense of humor to the people.Then it would be as if it would grow, the sorryness of the crowd, so that when he would come a lot, he could not do it for Allah.The name of what you have earned in the name of Allah is the best thing you have earned is the best thing, and what we have brought out is a matter of earth now from the earth.Whatever plants are coming.Even if it is a whirlwind, what is inside it is also defeated, then Allah has created you.You have worked hard.Everyone has run.Do not mark the wealth of the wealth of the timm bubb al -khaibis -munnah and the garbage of it.You have to give him two sarcasm.If there is a pile of wheat, it was reading the rain somewhere.Take it out of the tayammum here.وَلَسْتُمْ بِسِزِهِ And you have not happened every day, it may be that you are needy and you need you, then if you give you anything, then you will not accept it.Be careful that whatever you find is found, goodness is to be found.Whatever is found, whatever you find, you cannot accept the junk with his own pleasure.Then see what the word of Ghazi is giving to him, who is giving it to Allah and giving it to Allah.In Hameed, in his own self, Mahmud himself is the good or the beauty or perfection of a person who should be revealed.Look, it is a beauty and a beauty that is evident by itself.Do not know what time will come to you tomorrow and commands you to do so and Allah is shouting for forgiveness from you and now seeing the

no greater good than that, there is no good than the people who are unaware of the people who are unaware and they are unaware.The Almighty is a minor, but those who have gone to the ridge on the porridge whose heart is satisfied is enough, the bank balance is also there.You also give charity, and you look at the eyes of Allah, and whatever you give, you obey the name of Allah.If you openly declare the charity, it is still fine and for the sake of the charity, then it is okay to declare the charity.At least the right of the poor is reached.The floor worship will be declared in mind.This bus is also put into the hearts of many people.Whatever you want to pray in the mosque, do your piety on the people who want to get the gutter.Hide the prayer which is a nafl, it is a great temptation.The expression of nafil worship is a great temptation and you give it to the servants.Fahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.Transformation

understanding.The book of Allah does not need to be read.The responsibility of the responsibility is that We have sent you, you have read to you the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Allah Almighty gives guidance to whom He wills, and whatever good you spend for you, whatever good you spend for you, whatever good you spend for you, and whatever good will be rewarded for you.Will get the reward of the reward when the reward was not spent, then the question of the reward would become an elasticity when the reward was not spent, then the reward would be an

will always take time, but it is always the time, but the stomach is theirs and they will be the ones who are surrounded by the path of Allah Almighty.No, what you believe in the generally unfamiliar person understands the land.There is no need for it.He never asked for it, but he did not ask for because he is not such a pile.It is not a question.He is not a poor man.He has applied himself to the religion of Allah.There is no need.You know those who know their faces that the effect of poverty comes to the face.If you are not getting from nutrition, then it is obvious that it will have an effect on the face.They do not ask people to ask questions.They are not like the siesel they have to get their head in their effects.Something that takes you out of you in this way will not ask for it.This is an important issue.It is a matter of time for those who take the time of the religion.What can be the source for them, I cannot even go to the interpretation here, but it is the end of the

misconduct of the cowards is on the basis of interest.It should have been, but later, it became the fact that I was shabbat with this verse with great wisdom.He would do it later in wisdom.Ojar is safe.To the needy or to the Dames of Allah, but now the good mindset that makes it a source of further earnings is a source of goodwill, so in fact, the sunshine is the culmination of disagreement and it is open to the needy, while the Qur'an and the recovery of the rumor will be related to this.Both have been brought to the competition.For the sake of Allah, paying money on Rabbajwi and Rabba Sud, Wama Attam Man Ribbon Lerbo Wafi Amal -ul -Nass Fala Yarbo gives whatever you give, that he is doing the wealth of the growing people, and you are receiving his wealth because of his wealth, because

Save, but Save is not to earn more, so that it is not because you have to pay your standards and reduce your standard of living and spend it for the religion of Allah, not because you save us so that they give us more interests to others without any interest.Here is a map of the Day of Judgment, it will be a map of the Day of Judgment.This is the case of the usurpers in this world, and if you want to see their map, they are looking at this tage.What is happening is that because of interest and the most important of them is the greatness of being al -Qa'ida, because they say that the restless is like a ribbon.I have bought the goods of a hundred rupees.It is a lot of Rs.The rent was rented, the ten locks were given to someone and started giving it four thousand rupees a month.It became interest.They do not feel any difference.Here Allah did not respond to their view.Dakam potatoes make the messenger that give you and keep the thing that lives.This is a matter of law.The difference between it is that there is one Flood Money Fluid Capital is one of the Fluid Capital House is one million, but the person who wants the late will take advantage of it.Duplicated they will be in some work.Twelve million can be made.It can also be eight.Eight can be left.If you take the fix, it is a matter of fact that even though it is commonly said, it is also capital.It is also a capital.The new copy will do something and it will apply something first.It can never be increased.It can never be fixed.Then it is forbidden and no one in them but Allah did not answer it.If the person who has reached his Lord has reached it and he has not returned what he has taken from it, but he will not be able to do so.The day will not be on them.He will be handed over to Allah.He will be forgiven if Allah wills and Allah wills, then he will also be presided over by the previous sweat.Three things grow together.As interest increases, these implants will increase the inflation.As a result, the intersection rate will increase as the intersection rate will be increased.It has been all that is like this, that is, like a glass of garbage, it will have a stone.If you have a stone, Allah Almighty raises charity.Allah has heard in the verse.Do you have a verse of Surah Rome.He does not like Allah.وَقَامُوا الصَّلَاتَ وَتَهُوا الزَّكَاتَ لَهُمْ عَجْرُهُ مِنْ There is a decision from Allah, who

شَيًا النَّفْسِن شَيًّا وَا There will be no injustice to them.Now the longest verse of the Quran is coming.The verse of the religion is a matter of Qur'an.The crying of crying says that Allaah does not listen to the cry of three kinds of people, one who writes or writes in a matter of affairs or not, and later weeps one who is tight in the hands of his wife and complained or even complained or cried.Come on, Allah Almighty or Tadil you Badin Lala Ujal Masman Fittabah The task of writing a booklet should not be denied.Allah has revealed it.He should write when writing people were very much.It is still a nephew.The one who wrote to him as Allah has taught him, then he wants to write the masters when writing the money on which the truth is coming when he wrote the right to write, which he did not write.I have been afraid of Allah and fear Allah, and do not reduce any of these things in writing from your Lord, فَإِنْ قَالَّذِي عَلَيَََََََََََََََََََََََ If the person who is

problem that if two men and two men are not available then one man and two women are available, then the question arises whether the woman's testimony is a matter of fact.The answer is that the answer is that Allah has actually placed the substance of the feminine within the woman.There is no problem on the emotions at the top of the emotions, and the Almighty Allah has said Safety ward is kept to forget if not forgetting it is a punishment or a memory from the Lord Shenley, which is my nasal, it is also a great half, but no one has been able to get out of the heart, then the matter of forgetting is that the safety ward has kept the woman more and more of her.There will be more opportunities on emotions that he has to reach him for something.This is the safety of the safety.It has to be kept more.Witnesses are not repeating.They should come where any testimony of Allah is hidden.You can see that you can give a lot of conditions, so you can do the welfare, but when the order is being written, then it should not be distinguished by Ella Ujlai and the small problem.There will be a lot of oral memory somewhere inside the story, which is the only way to become an abomination.It is not necessary in the Shariah.Celebrate and celebrate the medicine when a future bargain is a bad thing.It is a future bargain.Loans are a debt.Slim is also a debt.Also, write down you so much wheat at this time, write it down and make two witnesses on it.If you do this, you will do harm.So it will be a matter of great sin for you, so it will be a matter of great sin for you.If you collect 4-5-6

read in which the verse is four verses.In the last verse that will come in the last verse, Allah will see the words of Allah, the words of Allah, who is the one who is in the heavens and the earth.Takhfahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Allah does not see your wealth and wealth, you will not see your heart and see your deeds in your heart, if you do not see your wealth and wealth, then you will be able to save your heart from Allah.Rumiyyah Shi'a -wa -Wa'awazm -mun Yashah, then He will forgive whom He wills and will punish whom He wills in the hands of Allah.It is not necessary for Allah to believe that He must be rewarded.This is the second thing, but the glory of Allah is very superior to Him, but it is much superior to Allah.It is absolute that it is absolute.Salat says, "Allah will do justice.We will be justice.This is the case.But we do not say that justice is obligatory on Allah.There is nothing obligatory on Allah.The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) believed that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has no idea that it is a great time when it is a great time.Even before it was the first experience, you could not say that you were a business man who was a business man.You are a business man.The family is doing business.So you will not be able to do so.It is a matter of great satisfaction for us that Allah Almighty has mentioned our faith with the mention of the faith of Nasal.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: What has come to the verse al -A'bir here is the same here as La Nafar Raku Ben Ahad Man Rasuli and the third burden has come to the fore that
