Umm Zamar Qur'anic Arabia non -Arabs, the first Surah al -Qa'id al -Hamad al -Hamad al -Hamad al -Qa'i al -Qa'atab al -Qa'ab al -Qa'alah, the Lord of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), the Lord of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), the first of this was completed in the Holy Quran.There is a tradition about the two verses of the Qur'an.In the Sahi Muslim, Hazrat Abdullah ibn Masood (may Allaah have mercy on him) said that the last two verses of Surah al -Baqarah have come to the Holy Prophet in the night.He did not fall on the earth.From time to time, the last verse in which these two verses are exempt, then the rest of the Holy Qur'an is unaware of the Holy Qur'an.But what Arabic is Arabic, as you know that there is a language that has dialyxes, Punjabi language has unknown dialyxes.How many dialyxic dialx are there in the Arabic language.One was but its tone was different, so Arafat was different, so it was learned that the Qur'an was revealed.It was the language of the Hijaz.It was the original Arabic language Hijazi nation.This is not the reason why the gentlemen of the Qur'an who were families of the Qur'an used to send their children to the Sahara that they should be raised there.They should learn the Arabic language there.We have wore an Arabic language in the Arabic language, we have wore our Word anciently anciently the Qur'an, we have come down from Surah Yusuf.The Qur'anic Arabic Ummah in the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), this is a clear, Arabic language in which there is no one to Allah, and it is a pursuit of Surah Al -Tahrir, in Surah Al -Zamar.Teach us to thank me for this great name.In the words, the words of Allah (may Allah be pleased with him).Allahu Allahu'a -ul -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu al -Allahu Allahu Allahu'a Allah Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Allah Almighty is also the Jew of Allah Almighty, whose language is Arabic, whose language is Arabic, the Book of Arabic is taught.The Qur'an is taught.It is the last book of Arabic.He is a stainer in the same way that he does not believe in being an Arabic language as Arabic, but he does not believe in his fiction and eloquence in terms of Arabic language.Then he has a special adultery.There is also the principle in the world today.Sutti is a great science.By this, I can prove that the most music is the Qur'an.There were no Hazrat Abu Musa Asri, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one day, at the time of zero night, he was on patrol at night, near his house.When he used to go to the house of Hazrat Umar, he used to listen to his tongue.Hazrat Omar used to read aloud.Hazrat Abu Bakr read in a loud voice.Hazrat Omar said, "Abu Bakr, you should just get the voice and you bring the age to the average.When you heard the Tarat of Almighty Allah, you met the next fast in Fajr.If the Almighty has placed in the throat, then in the throat of Oti Tabzamara Mann -e -Dawood, the last thing to note is that the greatest favor of the Quran is the Arabic language.When I started today, you will also be able to read what Urdu was Wali Shini.Then what he did, he has changed.Now he is in Urdu case.He has been in the form of Persian.How many forms have changed English, but Arabic is established for which the Qur'an comes to the ground as we have to bow down to the ground.The Qur'an is the Qur'an stabilizer in the same way that the Arabic language created a stubbornness and intercourse in the same way.This is the honor of the Quran.He used to have many names for the horse.Thousands of words will be found for the city.Five words for the city.Five words for the sword.Siyati Rahmatullah has been counted fifty but he is also not a list because it does not include an important name Burhan.It is the most important name of which the Qur'an will be discussed later, because the most important thing is that it is static in it.Then, according to his attributes, al -Karim al -Hakim al -Azim al -Majid al -Mabin (may Allaah have mercy on him), Bashar Bashar Naziz Aziz Aziz Aziz Aziz Aziz Aziz, And from what stomach it is made from what stomach it is made of an opinion that it has a derivative.It is not derivative.It is not derived from any stomach and you are also broken.One of the names of Allah is considered.He is not derivative.It has knowledge and he is the name of Allah.People say that it is not even knowledge that it is also derivative.It is also derivative.As Hakim is the attribute of Allah.But what is the opinion of the Iqbalism, which is almost consensus is that it is not in it, it is not derivative, but then there are two opinions that what is Maddah is a kafr kaf rah nun and one Qur'an is the opinion of two different materials that the Qur'an comes out of them.In the ihraam, if Amrbi and Hajj are also collected, it is the Hajj Qur'an.It is the use of the Qur'an and the Qur'an.Similarly, the Qur'an is made of the Qur'an.What is the meaning of the source comes in the meaning of the source, ie the read and a Qur'an.And its verses are comprehensive.This is the word debate of the Qur'an is the next debate and the next debate, and in which category of the Qur'an on the Reachs, what is the category of the Qur'an?What is the Qur'an?The Messenger of Allah and the lion are not even their own glory.The matter is that those who follow the limits are the people who come out of the limits.People who come to Lau Bali are followed.As I told you, the verses of Surah Haqqah are the verses of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).It is not a matter of free spectrum from the Qur'an.It does not have a rush.There is a rush within the free lion.It was the practice of Majid only after the Qur'an and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became and the Qur'an became.They will not talk about the chapter, then they will go ahead.Now the article will go ahead according to the article in the Wab.According to the story, the Qur'an does not meet the book of this book.The book which is the madness of the world in the world is its style.It has a formation.There is a form of articles.It is not even the articles.Each articles are complete in its place, but it is different from other articles.And Divine Orange is a combination of the sunshine of Allaah.It is a case that is a case, so it is Collection of Divine Orange.It can be said to him.If there is no harmony between them, then the Khutta will become non -murderous.People who are not felt will be attracted.If a report addressed and addressed, the other is that there is a heritage of the Khutbah that there is a statement that is a matter of fact.Will not do because people know today's era, people have knowledge but you will write in the book.Then you will have to explain the whole event when you are referring to what happened but the passenger inside the end is present and the only gestures that will be addressed to him are very important to you.Addressing and at any time, which is not even here, he will start addressing Nawaz Sharif.Brother Nawaz Sharif is not here but the speech is fixed.He is making a political speech.You will do this and Nawaz Sharif is doing it wrong or your sister is not your case.You are not present.Whatever abuse was given to President Ayub Sahib, he himself did not exist.If he was not present, he had to return to the address.Who was talking to whom I was talking to him.What happens is to note that this verse is currently the same.Who is being addressed in it.The top thing is that the call is not just appealing to the intellect, so the speech is called the speech of the people in the speech, while you are not able to say that you are not able to speak.There is a writing to the people, but within the call, not only the intellect is also appealing to emotions.Now, all these artifacts are mentioned in the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qummal -ul -Ma'adar -Jait -ul -Mujahid, is present, and the last thing is in this case and in the first place, and in the first place, it is very common and in the first place.There should be comprehensive and comprehensive, which is why it is specific to the specifications that have come to the point.This is the reason why the verses and the last verses of the Quran are most important in the forms of the Qur'an.The first verses are very important.If Nadad is not so, then the last thing is that in the case, it is always a matter of one thing that is a man who is in the mind of my Semin, but the right left will talk about any story.Until people used to listen, they are ever crying.Sometimes the mango man will also promote that he is talking around here, but when he was the last speech, when the speech ended in his mind, he wanted to sit in his heart.The style of the Qur'an is the end of the next debate.Come on the next debate.The letters will be al -Hamadah.The characters are connected.The words become the word.There is one thing about them, but the fact is that the Qur'an is his own, he cannot be speculated on any other resolution in the world, but because he was ancient, he said to the Quran, he said, "It is the form of a madman, as Hafiz's madness is in the shape of another." Others resemble that they are then born
