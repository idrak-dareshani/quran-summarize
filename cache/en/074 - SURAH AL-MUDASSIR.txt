and the Ulema -e -Nafi'ah and practically the righteous, the Lord, the Lord, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).One of the traditions of al -Mudassar is not that the first seven verses of it are the first revelation that has been revealed to the Holy Prophet, and it is appropriate to mention it since the Companion is the attitude of the Companions, but it is not the first revelation that the first revelation came to you, the first revelation of the Surah Al -Aqsa, the Surah Al -Alaq.And there are the first seven verses of Surah Nun, then there are ten verses of Surah Muzammal.After their nudge, it has been a period of time.During this break, which is in particular, the Holy Prophet did not want to be unaware of the nature of the Holy Qur'an.That is, the teaching of the Holy Prophet is not in the worldly manner that he has learned the words of the Holy Prophet, and then he has not read the books after that, in this sense you were merely, we will not say that you did not know that you were in the world, but you did not know the Qur'an, but you did not know the world.From you to fast and when it was a break, it was a

that it would be able to enter the Holy Qur'an.How much the Qur'an was ignorant in this Qur'an, meaning that if you are spitting something louder to hammers, then I use the same word in your heart, in your heart, in your heart, in your heart, if you are spitting something louder in this Qur'an.It is said that when this Qur'an is in the soul, now it is Surah Madder, however, the first three verses are increased here and understand it well.Understand one verse or Iwahl or Iwahil Madraser understand one thing from them that the Prophet's life is a period of time when he was thought to be a man of thought.Childhood is spent in this regard, then come to the childhood and then what we call the Donance that is also in the mushroom.Then you have done business.So think that as an employee as a

sense that a certain period of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) was thought to be, then Ibn Nawfal now saw why he was not considered a Companion.After that, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not present, he was not present at the time.He has confessed to the Prophethood.He is the same as the Holy Prophet, when Hazrat Faraqa had to see that the son of my son,

lot of money.It was a lot of money.Mumdud and I Given a lot of goods which are spreading goods inside the cities.Shaheeda sons are in front of me.I sold blood for him.Blood was pronounced.Then he wants him to give him even more.Now he became an opponent of our verses.This man was very old and he used to say that he was saying Muhammad, but it was all my friends who had my own friends.It was a matter of fact that Mohammed used to do something like that.At times, it was talking somewhere in the Chopal that we say that one of us says.This is a magician.It is a highway.People come from outside.I had to talk to the Holy Prophet and there was some concern that it had some effect.It was returned to the house.What do we think?Do we think it is a highway?Does I know of the highways who

has not been viewed.Nineteen is the only one, so what is such a large number, so the verse that made it a great deal has come down and we have made these frustrats that are not a human being.It is not a human being that you will take this one man ten, this number that we have told you only because they could be a book for the disbelievers.There is a newness in the Sharif of Tahsim that it was in fact the number of nineteen, so for the people of the Book, the greatness of believing for them is increasing.The two faiths of the believers will be increased.He who reads from Allah to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his belief in his belief in his belief.The lubricants who do not want to believe in the truth and the disbelievers who have determined that we do not
