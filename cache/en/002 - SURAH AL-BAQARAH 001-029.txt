Now, Bismillah -ur -Rehman -ur -Rahim, now this Surah Al -Baqarah is starting.Surat al -Baqarah, which is a gathering on 286 verses, is wearing almost the Fools.Everyone knows that this is the greatest Surah in terms of the Qur'an, but this is not the case with Khajam.Sanam -ul -Quran is the checkpoint of the Holy Quran.It is Surah al -Baqara.After two Surah Madani, but both of them have no alphabeticals, nor is there any other word of the Holy Qur'an.In Surah Isa, or in John -ul -Nass and Surah Aida, or Yuh -ul -Alazina Tuberculosis, no alphabet is a direct address.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has also declared Zahir.Almighty Almighty, this Surah Mubarak should be divided into two parts.It is said that you will see the balance that although the number of stops is low, but the number of ventures is high.One hundred Baban is high.The number of rods is high in the second part.But the number of Ayat is from one hundred chunks, which is why I have suggested that I have some facts because of these names.Why is almost all his debate?The division is not divided, I will not explain later when we will arrive at the first part of the first part I have divided the first part.There have been twelve thirteen years, and during the twelve thirteen years, the Qur'an has been revealed.In this regard, whatever wisdom and the basic invitation have been eliminated in the Qur'an, it has been removed here and put it in four hips.Summary is in these four members, then there are ten hips, which are the biggest harassment address.It is neither thankful for not thanks, and the result of all this is in the last four members that you are now being subjected to the position on which you have been holding for two years, and now you are shaking you in the form of a new Ummah who has come into existence.Sanbal, what is the symbol?The Qibla will now be the Qibla of the former Ummah, the Qibla will now be tragedy.Now the Qibla of the people of Tawheed will be towards Mecca.Ha Mann Ha -ul -Ha'ida is alienated.There are some codes in the Secret Bases, which also makes sense that this thing is really coming from the correct source, but the meaning of it and its agreement is on it.The Ummah did not accept it.The Ummah and the Kunnas are on the other side that no one knows its meaning and meaning except Allah and His Messenger.The second thing that came to the point is that if it is part of the twenty -eight, fourteen used is not used, whatever word is not taken, and those who have suffered a loss without point, then there are three Surahs in which one has come to Surah Aqaf, Surah Note, Surah Suites.There are two two, three of which have come to three, then four have come.How did the word scholar take this last word in the last words of Anna Allah Almighty Allah knows Allah Almighty Allah knows the rest of Allah, but if he has been considered as Umar Ummah, but that his opinion is not accepted by the first of his most important differences, which is not a matter of great agreement.This Surah is being revealed.I have been repeated.It has been twelve years.It was a group of good deeds to the Holy Prophet, who said at the invitation of the Holy Prophet and followed your teachings.It is a group of Bakr.And a third group was being born in Medina, she is still in Ambroncusti that the midwife is the plaintiff that we believe but do not really believe these three types of groups will always be found in the world.Now I am bringing it to it.Tanil is the cause of the invitation that will be a revolutionary.If the system is burning, it is obvious that those who have Wasted Interest in this system and those who have prevalences, who have the interests, must protect their system that there will be a loss in confrontation, it is not a revolutionary invitation that they do not have the right to accept it.With the ailus and then the whole answer, give evidence of Mardi.After all, now those who come to Jandini are present.Despite knowing about it, it is okay to say that what they are saying is how to believe that There is a jaw, but he is made of oat -e -lea, so how do you get up?An invitation for them is no preaching, no preaching is no longer useful.The third level is for people who are either at the beginning with the intention of the pride, there was a problem that had accepted the invitation for which they had accepted it or that they did not come to their place when they came to it.Fandaks are abducted, sometimes some are gone, then somewhere else, then some are left, then the third class is the claim that the claim is, where we have accepted, it is a bit of a matter of fact, but wherever the difficulty comes, it is not possible for us to do so.The word has not come because it is built from the disease, it is the disease and what is within the disease is a hypocrisy that is falling from the seeds which will appear that hypocrisy will be exposed to the whole of Hasani.َََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََََ number ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔ The prophecies were present in the previous books and because in this Surah Mubarak, what is the direction of the original book is towards the former Ummah, then the Muslim Ummah is the Book of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).The book is a man whose predictions were present in the Torah Tanjil.الْعَالَمِينَ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِنْ رَمْبِ الْعَالَمِينَ فِيهِ حُدًلْمُتَّقِينَ فِيه فِيه اللَََََََََََََََََََََََََََ If you will end with the hadeeth, you will finish the rabba, then both of them will be friends who are sitting with the Qur'an Stef.The number one is written in the margin.Avoiding the effect of piety is to be understood.The belief in it is to save it.People who have nature have moral senses.They want to avoid bad things.They want to achieve good.They are the ones who will be able to benefit from it.It is very clear in the effect that Tahwel is specially known as the tree is known by its full.This is the whole of the Qur'an.Zikr is full of Bina Naslum Mann Allah Yak Lusa Famaf.Verifying can see from you you can see from you who will understand that it has nothing to do with it.There is no point in the Qur'an.APPEARANCE Brainy Book is not the fact that appearance is not, the truth is behind it and a phrase of Confucius that was a great truth and philosopher, China's great rights and philosopher and a prophet may not be able to say that his teaching is a moral education.Are certain things that is not not being more real than what can be seen and there is not not having than that what can be heau is that the facts that cannot be seen with the eyes and cannot be heard from the ears and there is no fact and there is no fact.Why not be seen there is not not having more than that what can not be Heard Al -Yumnun Multan and Salabun Salaf, and Mama Sanja, we have to spend the time of self -reliance on the people of the people to spend the time of self -reliance.For the sake of Allah for Allah's blessings, Allah Almighty Yumnun Bummun Alaiko Wama Anzal Mann and He believed in what he believes, and he has been nominated before you, and what has been made before you is a very important word that is common today.No, no need no need is that the Hutnik may have been refrained but no benefit.It is absolutely wrong.It is a boss of the Qur'an and how much of the Qur'an is being said.Faith is not just on the Qur'an.Understand that these books have been distorted, so there will be no evidence of these books on the Qur'an that will be appointed from the Qur'an.We will not bring any of these books as an argument, but where the Qur'an is not being negated, many facts are found in us.I am not mentioned in the Qur'an, the mention of Hazrat Noah.All things are important to understand what it is, اللَّذِينَ يُوْمِلُونَ مَا The word of faith for things is true for the Hereafter.Legend and say something unlucky, say, "Allah, how Allah, the faith of Allah, the faith of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) is true of the Hereafter.They believe in the Hereafter.They believe that it is also a matter of fact that the Jews are unaware when they believe in the Hereafter.The result of this book of Muhammad al -Rasoolullah (peace be upon him) is the result of the people who are guided by their Lord, who were also guided by them, and this complementary guidance is also fulfilled in the Qur'an and Muhammad's Umayyad is also doing it.Insha'Allah will be at the beginning of Surah Mominun, but that those who are well -known are the same people, then they have been shocked like the Companions in the Tibetan Khas.Zarrathhm -Um Lam -Tum -Jalh -La Yam -ul -A'am -ul -A'am -ul -A'am -ul -A'am, surely those who disbelieve and refer to the disbelievers, we cannot take it in common, so we will take it to the common man.There is no attention on the blasphemy.The truth is not clear on it.So if this is it, you will explain it to him.He will benefit from waiting and discrimination.One is the one who recognizes the truth and then and then due to the prejudice of the people because of the prejudice because of the prejudice.There is equivalent to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Sleep can be awakened.How to awaken how Allah has deprived them of their hearts.Why did it not be deprived when they recognized the truth and rejected them.This is the cloak of the eyes of the Afsar -e -Hamm and the eyes of his eyes.Surah Esim will come back again with many evil and child, and there is a great punishment for them, and it is a great punishment for them.It became the other group.In one of the rupees, two came together.Tell them they are on the way.They are the heads of the Holy Quran.They are blessed with the Holy Quran and the sacred fruit is the fruit of the sun.Those who say that they have peace on Allah and on the Day of Asr, they are not a believer here, even if they have a good understanding of the best of this thing.It has been established that these hypocrites are religion and the word hypocrisy or hypocrisy did not come here, but Maulana Stahi Sahib has made a show which is very valuable.
