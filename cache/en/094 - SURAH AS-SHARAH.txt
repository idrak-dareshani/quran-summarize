Surah Al -Nushara Bismillah Rahman -ur -Rahim -ul -Nam -N -Nashir -luk -Sadr -e -Wa'maz -e -Annnah -e -Bazar -e -Zar -ul -Zar -e -Zah -Zahir -e -Warr -e -Warr -e -Lakh.Didn't open?Didn't you give you?And didn't you pick up the burden on you?الَّذِي انْقَدَ الزَهْرَكْ, who was visiting your grave, was giving a visit, and We have raised your remembrance, فَإِنَّ مَعَلْ عُسْرِ عَسْرَِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِ Yusurk is certainly easy with difficulty, surely it is easy to have it easier for F َ ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔.There were Mushtaqs, Dawat is in preaching and because of the people who were shouting at you, you were hurting here.It is not actually the case.It is also true in their place and it is also known that these are the worst of the past, so in this period there was no much more than three years of this way.Anything that is saying that the Bani Hashim is coming, the day is coming, it is very important that the day is coming later.It is actually what is actually what the person who prophesies with Allah, who wishes to be sitting with Allah, and the Messenger of Allah is obliged to do so.The servant of Allah standing towards the imagination where he is standing towards God.What is his qualification at night?What is his heart?What is the prophets of his heart?At this time, the case is currently pursuing within the spiritual middle of the spirit, and when he is going, someone said that it is wrong to say that it is wrong.One of his distinctions is where he wrote to the heart of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).He is the Lecture of the Force, which he has given the words of Shaykh Abdul Qudus Gangohi Rahmatullah.At that time, the meditation I was in the grace of the presence of the Holy Prophet was now.Now I have come to Darbani.If you have to pray, then the Imam will have the profession.He said, "Allah should have to do it.Another system is the system.It is the form of a party.It is desirable and one is a human being.There are some other demands of a human being.As you have been told to the Amosi every time, you see the Almighty Allah, and if they are talking, they are talking about it every time they are talking.If the intention is being found, the pleasures that were in it were in it.It was gradually your mind, which has been diligent and then when Allah Almighty added many people into it, then the satisfaction that a person is the one who is alone with the Maulana Rome, and it is a good time.It is said that it is a rain that there is a phase in the rain that the vapors are going up from the sea.There is no need to be transparent.It has to go to Nestal Bang.He went up.He went down.He took the shape of the rain.He now washed the atmosphere and cleaned it.Then he left the sea and he left the odor there, then he was cleansed and cleaned.This is what it is happening.Someone said something.Someone said something.Someone said something.Now you need to have a bride.Then you need to make the bride again.Then the rock will stand again.For preaching, you are back towards Allah.Now you are going to the khumk.You have the path towards Allah.Finally, therefore, the rumors of Allah's rumors were called Rabak Wahdafar, then you would be in this task, and then the Hadith made the last decision.It is found that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) has given the news in his disease when you prayed.You have ever come out of the disease.You came out.Hazrat Abu Bakr was praying.He does not remember the safe man even if he wants, the result is that if he is now and in the world, then the man has accepted Allah.If you gave it, Allah Wafar Rafiqllah, who was embracing this, is to keep the matter within the world, the spiritual and the spirit of the spirit that comes with Allah, where is the capacity and where he quickly said that I think that if it was a great time, it was a great time for them to do so.The stages of training were not yet fulfilled.It was only the people of Makki and Medina who were deaf in this way through your training and they benefited the whole of the Arabs, and they have not yet received the time for your training.
