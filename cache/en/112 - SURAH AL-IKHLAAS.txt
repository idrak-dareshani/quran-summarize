The greatest form of Surah al -Khalsa Qur'an, which the Holy Prophet said, said that the Qur'an is the equivalent of the third Qur'an.Allah is alone.Allah Almighty Allah is the same as the same.Hayat's knowledge of his knowledge of his remaining creatures within the universe is all thanks to it.The living and the rest of the universe is due to his attention.He did not give birth, he did not give birth or his birth, nor any of his children, nor any of his children, nor any of his juru, nor his wife, Mutthahbat -e -Baitam, and the Qur'an.The angels made the daughters of God.Some people made it a son for him, made Jesus Christ and made the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).From a position, we have no such thing as the essence of it.There is no such thing.There is no one.No one is our authority.
