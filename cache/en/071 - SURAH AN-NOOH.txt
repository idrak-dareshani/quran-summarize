Surah Al -Noo'ah (peace be upon him) mentioned Bismillah al -Rahman al -Rahim when we were reading Surah Hood.That is the punishment of Adham, there is a punishment on them.Take it and believe me.If the king is the king and his safe secretary there, or called Ford Minister, he is holding a great deal, and he did not say to the people that you will not bring peace to you.Now he will say, He will say, "Allah's representative will go but will go to my command.He who obeys the Messenger of Allah.If you obey Allah, then the Messenger and the Prophet have placed this duty in Zen.Allah will make some sins of you." If you have some good deeds, you have some good deeds, then the servants of whom you have taken the right month, whose honor was attacked, you will not give good deeds to you.No good deeds are not yours.Leadership will take you the opportunity to spend life in the world.Like myself, I have called my people day and night, even in the daytime, I have called my people day and night.There is no addiction to anything else, but as much as I call them, I will forgive them as much as I call them, as much as I call them, as much as I call them.وَسْتَقْ It is well turned up so that no one can go inside the voice.This is the mystery of the scene, then I also called them a declaration, and the secret secret also went to the secret calls and also made the call of the petty, I said to them, 'Make their Lord, that's the best of all.He will leave the sky in the direction of the sky, ie rain and rain in the sky, there will be a laugh in Mecca, as we have been in Surah Dakhl, or as a nation, it will be raining down.وَهُمْدِتْكُمْ بِعْمَوَالِمْ وَبَنِينْ وَبَنِينْ وَبَنِينْ و و و و ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا ا و What has happened to you?فَإِنَّ بَكْشَ رَبِّ قَلَ شَدِيدِ His hold is very Sabbath.You have no fear.Do you not see how God created the sky?Al -Shamus has kept the Suraj and Surah that he is a calf.Allah has raised you from the earth as it is raised from the earth.All this is coming from the earth.Your body is coming from the earth.Gradually, the younger animals, then the bigger the bigger, then the big one whose last the word is, what is the Homo Spids and the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).He will take you again.I have great paths that are the ways that Allah has created for you, but now it is crying.Secondly, I invited this invitation.Rabbah Annahmah َََََََََََََََََََََََََََََ These wealth their children made them even more rebellious and abducted and overwhelmed.They are not ready to listen to them.Allah is a great stake, and these people have done a great stake in the nations.They are our saints.Keep them firmly with the masters and your passers -by, with them as before it came before, do not listen to Muhammad from here.Who will be left with the words of Yogosh, who will be the welfare of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), who will be the welfare of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).So the Ghaus, who is understood, is the listener, and our cry is rope, it is a research about it.It is also Allah and it was Allah who is the Prophet (peace be upon him).Or they respected, okay we respect them.I saw a picture with my eyes.What a great man was in Mokan Lahawar.This is the Maoist Nadin Ajmeri and this is the Bakhtiar Qaki and this is Baba Farid Shikar Gunsh all three are free of time and this picture can be taken on it.The same thing was increasing.Then the booths were to be thankful.It was not a matter of time.Leaving them to leave them.If you mislead them many of the wrongdoers, then it is not to increase the misguidance and this thing for these wrongdoers, when the heart is gone, it is as if Moses did not say that if Moses did not see it now, if Moses did not believe it, if Moses did not believe it, if Moses did not say it.You have given the faith to the faith.All sins have become.It is no longer a belief.It is Babla.The man was admitted to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).All the helpers of Allah, the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).If you have left them, you should give them the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).In Lynoj, his seed has been killed.Now, there is no good deed, he is not even more than a criminal generation.It was more difficult than Shaheedullah's name.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is no longer treated without any treatment, without any treatment, and the greatness of the Lord, the Lord of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Say anyone who enters my house with faith in faith, and the Simm Murm and the women who believe in some times are the next, but not yet, but not yet.The wind is then the willah tzdad al -za'l -ul -Muminin -Allah for these wrongdoers, but if the discipline of the Qur'an was focused on the disaster and destruction, we would not have doubts that this was the case that was the case of Allah.The prayers of Ado and such a prayers were said to the Holy Prophet, O Prophet, you just pray for Fasabar Surah Jumillah Salal -Sa'alim -Ba'a'abab -wa -waqqi -al -Kafir -ul -Ladh -i -La'a'in -La'a'i -i -Lishah.اللّٰهِ ذِلْمَعَارِ تَعْرُجُ الْمَرَاكَتُ وَرُّهُ إِلَيْتِهِ وَمِنْ قَالَ مِقْدَارُ كَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَهْ Giving you three years, five years, the Barak Allah and the Holy Qur'an, the Holy Qur'an, the Holy Qur'an Winfa'in -Wa'atat -e -Baal -e -Ayat -Wa'at -e -Tah -e -Tahkam.
