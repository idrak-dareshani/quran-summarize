Surah Al -Aadiyat Bismillah al -Rahman al -Rahim al -Rahim -ul -A'addiyatat Zabah -e -Falmuriyyat -Qaddah -e -Falmgh -e -Sabah -e -Fasir -n -Naqi -ul -Ba'a'at -ul -Ba'am and the last five and the last five.Surah is the style of the style that begins with the clean fate of the Fat -e -Fat -e -Fitz -e -Fizjar -e -Zujjir -e -Ferr -e -Wa'lzar -e -Zarun -Zarun, and then then I am the Oli -ul -Fitr -ul -Fitr -e -Farah.It is the last and the last is the consensus of these types of horses, who are the horses or witnesses who are witnesses to the horses who are removing their horses, then they are giving away, they have no differences.The sparks are pouring out when they hit a rock, the sparks come out.The culture of the Arabs was the time for looting and looting.They had time to loot and loot.Smallowers offsetting mourning while people are asleep with a lot of skoms.If the patient did not come all night, then it would come with it.Which is a culture but who is being used on the horse is good this horse who is also used in their wars while there are warfare wars.Sabah -qasqqina bahh -nqaqi and then he goes away from the air and goes away.The horse is dying like half the horse is dead.Why is the horse taking this risk, it is actually the main point of the case, which is the only thing that a man who owns his own is not the creator of him.He talks where he is commanded.فَلْبُورِيَاتِ قَدْحَنْ فَلْبُغِيْرَاتِ فَاسُلْنَ بِهِ What we have ourselves in the Surah Qiyamah, who has fallen in Surah Al -Qa'im, knows that I am doing it, but this is the wealth of the wealthy, but this is the wealth.And the love of wealth becomes very severe, because of the wealth of wealth and love removes the distinction of haram halal, although its soul reproaches, but it is a sign of Allah in the Almighty of the Almighty.Does it not know when whatever is in the earth, what is in the graves will be removed, and whatever is in the graves, they will be removed, whatever is in the earth, and whatever they are hidden in, they will be removed.Surely on that day, their Lord will know what they are aware of what they are aware of, and will take account of them, and will take account of them.Mention
