Salt -ul -Taqasawa Basmim -ul -Allahu Wahmahiman Wahayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyya I see a stream of the world but they do not have the zeal of wealth.When it is recruited, it is filled with the tomb of the grave.It does not fill in the world with any other quantity, and it is remembered by the Surah Hadith.There is no point in this negligence, in this negligence, no matter what the word of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) will come to the forefront of death, as if you were dead in Surah, if you were to die, if you were to death, if you were dead, you would come to Surah.If you do not want to come, if you do not want, then those facts will be overflowed.This is exactly as the first of the last paradox of the last paragraph of the last paragraph of the last paragraph of the last paragraph.There is no one to know that you know, the knowledge of the belief that you know is the knowledge of the world, now that our knowledge of the world is true, the knowledge of our believer and the right of the right.You have seen somewhere you have seen.You have said that you have not seen the fire.But you have not seen the fire.With any argument, you have informed that the fire is on fire.It is certain that you have gone and saw that you understand that it is fire.There are nothing, then there is actually the light somewhere and those who are coming out of the wires are coming from the wires.The looks that are visible are not the fire, not the fire, but if you have gone to the tamarind and when it is burned, now it is true where it is the fire that you have received this world.Seeing Samma Latribnabnah Aiyn -ul -Yaqinin, then I will be asked to ask the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).What blessing We have given you and what have you done there?
