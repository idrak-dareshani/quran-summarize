This is Surah Surah al -Kafrun, as if it was a declaration that the last thing he had offered his invitation has been made clear and the nation is not obeying it.Then he declares that I have nothing to do with you.The people of God, the servants of God, are al -Kafirun as if the announcement is being made when it is being held.Do not worship the person who worships him, he is negative.They say, "We worship Allah.Yes, we worship some other things with Him, but if the worship of Allah is with the polytheism of Allah, then it is negative.It is absolutely the village of which you are worshiped by Allah, who is your own worship." I am not always worshiped by you, and I am always worshiped by whom you are worshiping.
