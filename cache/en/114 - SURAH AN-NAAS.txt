The case is now the last case.My view is the last group of the cases that started with the Malch, which is the case, except for all these two cases, and only the two cases which are the mediocre and the first grub that was the first grub which was the only case.The question that is here is that there are two forms here, the small and the other two are the ones who are all the cases and the last case will be found.In the first case, I will tell you that Bismillah Rahman -ur -Rahim Qul -e -Awaz Barb -ul -Nass says that I come to the asylum of all human beings.It is a matter of evil that is hidden from the money that is hidden in the wives of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).So in this way, it is embedded in the human being as the blood is embedded.This is the devil who is the devil and you have read it too.If Limdo keeps it to inspire him, the devil has no authority.Our own sophisticated circle, which is our Animand Instant, increases the auspices of our ancestors, for which the Hadith says that the land that is born of the heart is born and that it is born in the heart of the heart.His Almighty has given him the rise.Why is it that you will mention that if you mention La Haul Villa Qawu'l -Allah, then when Zikr is empty, if the heart is not remembered in the heart, then the devil will come to the throat and the devil will influence it.Kine is one of the jinn or among the human beings.Now, please connect it.You are the first case in Surah Fatiha.Praise be to Allaah.So the same is the one who directs us to give a protection from the devil.The same thing is the same.The owner of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day The Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Malik Al -Nas Dua Dua Prayer One We will want to tell you the translation of it when you listen to this prayer with this prayer.To remove this horror of isolation in the grave, the fact that I used to read the Qur'an is that when it used to pray when there was still a fire in the hearing, I thought it is a phrase ahead.The first part of the prayer, Allah will make this horror to me for the sake of tears, but may make the Qur'an through the Qur'an and have mercy on me.Yes, the Qur'an has to follow his Imam.Then, praying to Allaah, then who is a man who decorates him.This is not a conscious decision, then it is a routine.Let me forget about what I forget about, and what I do not know from it and we are the most jaugal people who know what is in the Qur'an, but pray that Allah Almighty should learn the Qur'an to learn the Qur'an.The knowledge of the Qur'an is very valuable.There is an art in the world.There is no art.It has to be learned.As Hazrat Ali said, "There are great indications or that I have a peaceful peace, whatever the person of the pearls, who wants to reach the bearer of the sea.It is hard to give whatever he gives thanks to the unseen and the one who becomes the height of the universe, without the effort, then he sits on his age and he sits on the sidelines of a place.There is nothing to happen in the tale of a place.There is also a dehydration that we have started in Lahore.Under the Anjuman Khadam and Quran, it is happening in Lahore.For many years, it has been a couple of years.It is starting again and it will start by February 23 before it will start.Hidden has been hidden from the office office.Five rupees is the tip of its prostitutes, but you see and take advantage of what we have read, but we have learned so much Arabic that we can understand the Qur'an Da'at.Do not do what the Holy Prophet has said that this Qur'an is either a world and medicine is in favor of you and if you read the Qur'an as if it is the right to read as it is right to understand as if you have the right to act as if you have the right to reach the world as if we have the right to convey it against you.He would come with the fact that Allah used to say that I was your Book.I did not read.I did not believe.Where will you be given here today?This will be given to you.This is what will happen to the end of the Qur'an.Tabia's words I have told you that you have worshiped Ghayat al -Haba Ma'at al -Khuda and al -Khazu Jan, to Allah that I am nothing.Bedka is in your hands in your hands.Mazen is all in my entire existence.The decision that is made about me will be based on justice.Written by Islaka?As -Salaok As -Salaok As -Salaok As -Salak As -ul -Aswalak As -ul -Aswak As -ul -Aswak As -ul -Aswak As -ul -Aswak As -ul -Aswalak As -ul -Aswak As -ul -Aswalak As -ul -Aswalak Asal -ul -Aswalak Asal -ul -Auk Asal -ul -Auk Asalok As -ul -Aswalak As -ul -Aswak Aslak Aslak Aslak Aswak
