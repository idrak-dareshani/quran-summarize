Praise be to Allaah.Praise be to Allaah.Allah Almighty Rabbana Tears of Happy Bahrna Wahmana Bala -ul -Azim -ul -Allahm -ul -Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah and the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).The Qur'anic division and division of the Qur'an had been completed about its editing that the Qur'an was completed in three stages.In the battle of Yamama, the security martyred was raised that the Qur'an should be compiled inside the book, so that this work was completed in the Caliphate of Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique, and for this, the name of the author of Hazrat Abdullah ibn Mas'ud was given the suggestion of his people.It was felt that now his writing style was also making a difference, so it felt that his skirt, a script that was agreed, should be done, it should be done, so this third phase was found in the Caliphate of Hazrat Usman (RA).In the cities who were then Muslim countries, a smoke was also given and the rest of the smokes were turned towards it, so it was said that within the century, these three phases that were mutilated and as I did, all of us acknowledge that the Qur'an is with us today.The number one is that the basic unit of the Qur'an is the basic opinion.We cannot say the verse.We cannot say the verse.We cannot say the verse.Egypt can not say that.We have to loot the same verse.The verses are big.There are obligations to say that one of them is not involved in logic, a grammar, a slogan, any principle of a statement as far as the number of verses is concerned.One of the major differences is that there is a disagreement with the verse that is written at the beginning of all cases, whether or not this verse should be counted or not.There is a case, which is not a verse in the beginning of which the verse is not Allah, at the beginning of the remaining 113 cases, then some you think that this will be made only, but in fact, this verse is written only to create a crop and difference between cases.On the basis of this, no person himself is a killer here to make any difference in it can change.There are verses of 6.5 thousand.The verses of the Holy Qur'an are in the form of forms.And its wisdom increases within the verses and the way in which different mutations are given in a thread, which will be delayed in a thread, which will bring the beauty of these mutations to the verses of the Qur'an, which are within one case, and all of them have a central article and a central article.In the Companions of the Companions, we get a form of harassment and or destination for the convenience that if the recitation of the whole Qur'an is to be completed within a week, then one should be read daily.Desmata is a bit bigger, but almost equal to the equation of the raw is not an attempt to establish an equality, and yet it is a good thing that if we keep Fatiha a joke and a case for the entire Qur'an, then the first sixth or sixth in the first sixth in the first sixth.Since you know in the last paragraph, there are small cases, the number is 65, the last number is that the last number is its multiple.In the time of Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf, this has happened and it is very thought -provoking and is really narrow -minded that the meaning and relationship that is related is kept in place, but the second division that has become known to us is the parable.If I want to finish the Qur'an every month, I want to read an end of the Qur'an every month, then read a mercy daily, but it does not contain the beauty in it.It is not too long that there has been another fact in the time of development and division of the Qur'an, and the fact is that the group of the Qur'an is a group of forms.In the present, Maulana Hameed -ud -din Farahi Rahmatullah was born in India a scholar who made the Qur'an his specialty that the verses that have been combined with the Qur'an are in the end.That she did not go to a time at a time, but in many times and Surah Bakr, what is her tongue in almost two years, then where to connect some verses, where to keep it, then what is the Holy Prophet himself?It may be that I want to make it first that if this thing does not appear to be in our eyes and their attention is not done, then it is as if it will be a matter of understanding in the knowledge of the Qur'an as we have to do something on the understanding of the oppressed, but this is not the case that the Qur'an has never said about the Qur'an.Wearing a repeated reaction, no oldness will be educated on it, and the scholars of the Ulema and the scholars will never feel Sir, so the Quran is moving forward as the world is moving forward.Could not come to knowledge because the scope of human information was still very limited.Who was Jalcardin.From the close, that thing has come openly, and in fact, it is the Holy Prophet's decree that his unlucky today will never end his today.Man will work hard.It is a call of diamonds and diamonds will come out.There is one thing in Haman.In the case, often and better couples have been given some examples of this.Even though the Qur'an is not created in the form of pairs, we will not apply it to it, but the total poetic creation spouses has such a quarterly statement that it is so favorable to Allaah that even in the form of the Quran, it is a matter of excuses to be in the shape of the pairs of joints.Somewhere you see there are some unique cases and among them when these things will come during these things, now I just have to walk very fast at this time.I want to sit in some places in some places that there are groups of three or three of them.In such a way that it is a matter of fulfillment of each other, in the same way when the cases come in the Quran, in the form of couples, one side of an article will come in one case.There was no modernization, so many words have come to Urdu in English now that if anyone else is seen in place, it will probably not be a common man.It is not a common man.They are themselves or other unique cases that you will find in the components of the crop.Now go beyond that.Now the real thing I want today is to describe a grouping of the Qur'anic cases in this regard.There is a lot of wisdom and the strange thing, and strangely it has come to the fore.In the context of the Qur'an, groups with the Qur'an are also found in each group, and one or more of the maternal for one or one group has been completed.From that each group has a vertex is a Queen, and in the same way that the case complements two and complements one of the same, the Mickey and Madani forms of each group complements a large manner in such a way that it is a group of big groups in which the group is in the first group.In terms of volume, it is also small, but there is a very heavy case.In the second group, two cases of Makki two Madani al -A'raaf al -Makiat al -Anfad al -Tawba Madaniyat are run.Fourteen cases are going continuously.Fourteen cases have now come to Surah Noor.This third group is completed.In the Chotot group, you will see the same thing.Eight Surahs from Al -Furqan to Surah Sajdah are Makki.They are very similar, but it is not a connection to this method.They have a couple in the same group.It is in the other group.There are ten Surah Madani from Surah Al -Hadid to Surah Al -Talaq.The prime minister is the first group of the first group.There are complementary orders that Surah Maida is more emphasized in this group, the former Muslim Ummah and the former Muslim Ummah, both Jews and Jasrah, are now criticizing them.They are also blamed.They have been given their resolution against them.And believe in the Qur'an.In the last group, all the two paragraphs, which are from Surah Malik, are advertised on the Mickey Surat.Finally, small Surahs come and come to Madani.They are perfectly researchers.There are also rods and most of them who are the other are the two of them.[Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to
