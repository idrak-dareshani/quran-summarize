Surah Abbas Bismillah -ur -Rehman -ur -Rehman -ur -Rahim Abbas and Tula Anjah -ul -A'ami Fama Yazkar Lallah Yazkar Fatnafah -ul -Azha al -Za'zar Ummah -e -Tashdi and Ummah Mann Yakashi Fanta Fanta Anna Talla Tallah Talla Qalla Tazkara Fahman Shah Zakhr Zakhdah Allah Al -Azim, about the Surah Mubarak, who wants the Holy Prophet to be the place of the Holy Prophet, as he can be raised, then he is pleased to perform it around, but there is no doubt that this incident has happened as it is a matter of greatness, and it is a matter of greatness.What is the better way to fulfill what has been put on me now.The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed that the Lord of the Lord, Omar Abdul Khattab and Omar Abdul Hashar Jinn Abu Jahl, must put one of them in my swing that they are such people.They are influential and influential in their society.Now, how is it that he is his own.Nabibina is now that he was a naughty, but he was not deaf, but he would have been assuming that at the moment, people are being communicated and those who are blessed.Allah Almighty makes one of them a linger.Some of the disadvantages were born to the Holy Prophet's theory, and the Holy Prophet did not agree like him.He changed and went from there.It is said that it is now a matter of submission to the Holy Prophet's place.There is no time for the Prophet.Barbara was going, who were laborers, who were slaves there.The word of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that Allah Almighty, who is the biggest mistakes of his great servants, is as if he has a great deal of sophistication.If all the problems are facing, then there is no need for any radiation.You turned again and again that a Navina came to him.If you are worried about them, you are behind them.These are the people who are not ready to listen to you.There are some dissatisfaction and taghfafar.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: This has come to the fore on various occasions, but it is obvious that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) is only Allah, the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).I am more effective, the status quo is to believe, come with them, join a movement, not for this movement, not for this movement, for that movement, for this invitation, it is useful for this cause, it is believed that the world is sure to believe in it, and then they believe in the world.From, this bridge, which we call it, will be faster than the hair and the sword, it is in the world.The two extremes remains the matter all the time.Someone who is a prophet because of his independence, self -esteem.So there are closeness and independence within these grooms.There is no one more aspect of it, this Qur'an is also being insulted.You are also giving them for this Qur'an.Read and listen and understand and understand.Then I hear.No no.It is an admonition that does not want to be pressure and this Qur'an is actually in the same way as it is.Where is this Qur'an?This is in the hidden book, it is in the hidden book.It is in the hidden book.He cannot touch it.Only those who are the pure angels.They have no psychic and they have no need for the universe.Where is the Qur'an?Where is this Qur'an?The original Qur'an is here.It is mentioned here.There were also people who were preparing the nails from there, they were sending them to the end.How ungrateful is this man to be killed by a person who is unhappy with the time he has created it from what he has created by Allah, who has created it from the nostrils.But every human being has an idea that today we understand the jeans.Every person will get in the context of the genes that he has received, either from the jeans that he is receiving to his mother and the father, or that the agreement in which God created him, he said, "We have also said that we have a good idea." Then we made it easy to find the way in it.It is also acknowledged how this phase is now tight with the mother's chase.The way it is to get out of how hard it is for a human being.But that is the way of the whole life, Samah Hamatat Wafaq Barrah then killed him and then entered him into the grave.Fati'l -ul -Fansanan Ma'atfar -munnah -e -Sha'id -e -Khulqq -Munnah -e -Faqih -Faqd -e -Sami'il Yasim -e -Samadh -e -Um -e -Um -e -Um -e -Allahi.There is no one, but he did not fulfill the thing that was commanded by the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Where is Allah giving it to Him, the Creator of His Creator, Faliyanzar al -Nusan -ul -Ala Ta'aamah, just look at his food.Then we have come out of the earth as it explodes.وَزَيْتُونْ What is the mutual use for you and for your chapters, where are these condemnations where Surah Naziyat and the fibrous of Abbas?فَيذَا وَأُمْنِهِ وَأَبِيْهِ وَأَبِيْهِ وَّبِيْهِ وَّبِيْهِ وَّبِيْهِ وَسَحِبَتِهِ (From his wife to his sons, from his sons, Lakal -Lam -Raim -Munnahm -e -Yum -e -Azin for every day for every human being.It will be made on a soul that will be completely ignorant of it.He will be psychological in it.Nazir Wujujohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Misters will be laughing at their faces and celebrating happiness.This is the shadow of them.
