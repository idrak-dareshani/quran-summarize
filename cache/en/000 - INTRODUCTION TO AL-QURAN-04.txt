The conversation that was going on in the previous session of the Holy Qur'an in the previous seat of the Qur'an, if some basic principles were taken into consideration, then five things were mentioned in understanding the Qur'an.Secondly, the Quran is divided into verses of the Quran and in the departments and the Muttahida Qaumiya al -Imran, where it is mentioned, it is said that the believers should keep their attention on the departments and believe that they have a right to believe that they are not believed in this matter, but they do not believe in it.The permanent and the unseen scholar, the universe, is in all its matters permanently, but there is a third category, which may be in the scientific fianomina that a person is in a state of affairs today, when he is more aware of the knowledge of the departments, and the human being is more aware of it.The purpose is to try to reach the original Madul.In the number four tuition, when the Qur'an was revealed in the special context of the mango and the special contractor, what was the original meaning of a verse that was understood, the traditions of Shaun Nadol would also be important, but since the Qur'an was not only for this period or for the people of this area, it was not for the people of this area.The words of the verse by making the words of the verse and the context of the verse and the context of the verse in the context of the Qur'an and the Qur'an, which is certainly in this regard can be achieved.We have made it easier to seek basic advice for mentioning the Qur'an for mentioning the Qur'an for mentioning the Qur'an for mentioning the Qur'an, so one who wants to mention it is enough to understand that it is enough for the Holy Qur'an to understand it.The correctness of the deity should be in view of the demeanor of his knowledge, if it is not intended, if it is not intended, the Qur'an is the most difficult book, but I have used a false nafly at this time.It is the most difficult book in the world.The Qur'an means the meaning of a sea that has neither food nor any layer of it.In spite of the whole rusty in it, it is still a felony.Two of the Qur'an itself is the Qur'an.My book, which I wish for Muslims, I have discussed in detail the rights of the Quran.What the first of them understood about what the contradictions in regard to the rules would be quite satisfied with the other.What did the Companions think of what they understood until they convey themselves to the footsteps of Muhammad Rasulullah.The rotation of the rotation of the rotation of the rotation, even the back of the back from behind, until the Muttafi Bareshah Raksh Din Hamasat, the next, said, "The sciences have moved forward with regard to the science of the Qur'an." Religions are the real truth of them.If our reforms do not understand, then the matter is understood.Now their level was so weak that their understanding was not possible.It was absolutely relieved that instead of supporting the time, they would go back and forth.Least is authentic.It is very important that Maulana Medi has written it very important.It is very important in the case of Gift -ul -Quran.It is very important and that the Quran is not a book that a researcher and researcher schools have to sit in their libradic and put the reference to it.After this power, the Qur'anic facts will be further revealed and further reversed and further reversed, unless the man will fall on the path of the Quran, the true reality of the Qur'an should never be revealed.He should write the details.Makes faith through the practice.I am adding a thing to it.Tucker and then the stages of jihad and murder so that the revolution came, and that the Qur'an is being revealed at every stage of this struggle, which is the problem of this stage which is the problem of this phase, which is the problem of this phase, if no one can understand it.Why is it being said that when someone is suffering in the same kind of revolutionary struggle, he will know that it was difficult or it was the problem or it was the stage that was then the time of Muhammad Rasulullah Wal -Azin Bahoo that it came at this time.The first is anot is also taught and dead body is a dissection, so the manual of dissection is the first book that we get.It is said that the victim will see it and you will see it inside it.It is a fiacia.And if you have made it just an academic exercise is a scholarly thing, then nothing beyond that, then the origin of the Quran, which is the origin of its essence, will never be revealed.Now, an important topic is the cause of the Qur'an.Al -Amin, your monthly sister has spent a blessing.You have seen me the dearest.You have proved to me and that you have given me to the Allama.There is also a compulsion for which I will be able to recite two places, Siloh Bina said, "Lamin -ul -Fitr Kufrova Mann al -Qa'abi al -Qa'aba al -Mashrakina, even the Tatiah al -Baqat -ul -Baqat al -Baqir -e -Nashir -e -Nashir, who did not know when they were unaware of Allah." Faha Books are made up of two things.O Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah is the argument on the Qur'anic Qur'an.Regarding these two things with each other, they understand that both are in this way.Both facts are together that can be assembled.Lastly, the last thing to understand is that the Qur'an will use the original motif of Muhammad Rasulullah, but I will use a word beyond it.It is necessary to have two things in this regard, which is said to be a joke and a habit, while a habit is created, the habit of being used to say that physical law is one is the water keeps it is the source of the Prophet Moses, and the right habit is a habit.Qalun is usually the rules of the laws that are broken and the revelation of a fact that the law that these physical laws is lawful about is burning, but it is a privilege that Ibrahim has not burned in the fire, and he is a habit of greeting.Claiming with the claim to be your authenticity as a summary of the truth and authenticity of your

thirteen.Bring any ten cases like this.One hundred fourteen does not happen.The third stop was removed.May Allah be pleased with you, but note that no one has done this coup, nor challenged this claim of the Qur'an, no one tried to compete, no one did not compose any of his writings or any of his compositions, and claimed that he would submit a commission, but we would like to see this.This is the real present of the Holy Prophet, but from what aspect the present is, it is a present on which the whole written is written, which is the reason for the reason for the current being of the Qur'an.It
