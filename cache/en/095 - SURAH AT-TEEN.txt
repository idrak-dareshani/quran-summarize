Surah Atim Bismillah -ur -Rehman -ur -Rahim This Surah is also very psychological philosophical and understand what it is.Whenever the servant of Allah whose moral senses are running, he is moving from there.There is a great example of society.Perhaps the great representative who is an example of this thing within the world is considering something about it, so considering that human beings reach the world that human beings are very despicable and very heartbroken.There is no good in it.There is no aspect of goodness and it is all that has no psychology or their psychology.Whether it is an insannia or anamin instant, you can tell your psychologist that whatever you are, can you tell you any good in you and tell you a good one who comes to a human being.The witness is olive and witness, and he is a witness.But a lot of spelling was connected to the creation.Moses received the words of the Hajjal Bal -ul -Amin and the peace city in which Muhammad Rasulullah performed the duty of the Prophet (peace be upon him).It is not seen that you will not find evidence that it was a great greatness in man.It is another thing.You think of yourself as a hawan.وَلَقَتْ قَرَّمْ نَا بَنِ بَنِ بَنِ اللَّهُمْ وَالْبَرِ وَلْبَهْرِ All these verses which in the Qur'an, which are weak in the Qur'an, is very weak in the confidence of nature.It is very below its animal existence.In fact, this animal has come down and stole it.We had created man from Sam, Sam -e -Raddunnah -e -Safil -e -Safil, who made it to Sam, Sam -e -Samfal, and now it has reached the forefront.What has to do now is to get up now.Now you have to work hard to rise up.The righteous is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Badalidin now added one thing to him that if you also see that some people are swollen, some are low, some are low, then the question is whether it should come out or not, then what is the thing that worships you and denying you?Almighty Allah is not greater than all the hackers, so did you see any Hakim who would hesitate to his righteous servants and his traitors and his rebels, then if there are these two types of roles that you see more in human beings, they are the other kind of human beings.We were also human beings.There is also a day, if the days are not attracted, then I will really get rid of the holes.
