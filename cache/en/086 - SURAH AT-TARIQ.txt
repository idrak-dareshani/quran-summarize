Surah Tariq Bismillah Rahman -ur -Rahim -ur -Rahim Wait -ul -Waitat -Waitatarq is by the heavens and the stars coming into the darkness of the night at night and the stars who come into the darkness of the night, do you know what?In these najam, the star sticky star knows that there is no soul on which there is no guardian on which there is no guardian.The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the angels who have been blessed by him for a human being, and the angels who wrote his worship, have a guardian on every soul of the whole soul.The creation of the water that comes out of the water that comes out of the water, Yakhlid Mum Ba'a'in -Islab -wa -Waltarib, and the man's stomach between his stomach and his ribs, which is with the thirty -three, with which it is on the back of it.That is, within the age, it goes down, but the real place is the same, its blood supply is the same, so the lead between the lead and the ribs of the lead and the ribs, and of course, the one who has created it can reunite it again, but it can be reunited here.Lakqqadar can bring it back, that is, he will bring his boss back.The day where all the open things go where the hidden things will be removed, wherever they will go, all the fibers will be removed.Rijah is the kind of heaven or medicine.This sky, which sees the rainfall, is intermittently, and it is medicine and medicine.It is the earth that flows out of the earth.The words are Faisal.He has sent down with the truth and it has come down with the truth.The same thing is here.Qayyida, O Prophet, these people are doing their own tricks and I am also doing my trick.For those who came later, the decision is that you do not want to come to your heart, and from your mosque, it is as if the Muslims are also being told, Winfallah waa'a'i -e -Balakim.
