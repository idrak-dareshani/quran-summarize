Praise be to Allaah.Praise be to Allaah.Wahm -e -Islam Siddiqullah -ul -Azim, then the rituals of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Holy Qur'an is the Almighty Allah, the Almighty, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), the recitation of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).The address of the former Ummah former Ummah Muslim Asrai with him started with the five -year -old in Surah Al -Baqarah and will start till the beginning of Raku in the house.I have tried to stop repeatedly and I want it to be well -known.Alaikum Waufwa Bahad -e -Ba'af -Bahad -kamm -wa -yiyyah -e -Yafir -e -Hahabun, and the Book of Books appears to be the words that the color of the next has changed or the color of the people of Emperor Allah Almighty Allah Almighty.فَضْبَبَلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ وَاتَّقُوا This is the style of threats, so I said that five workers are the winner in this address, the rest of the lights are the best of these verses and the brackets of these two verses.A detailed resolution against him is a crime, which has led to the disability from which he has been disabled for two thousand years, and in his place, the new Ummah Muslim Ala -ul -Salam is now his installation and his installation of the Holy Qur'an is not known as the Holy Qur'an.Where did the matter go, where is it going, what is link, what is the relationship, what is the context to say that I know that time is short but I am giving more importance to this.Then there are some such universal truths.The great facts of such great facts that are eternal facts are not related to a particular broom from a nation.They are the principles.If you come from the car where they come to the molal laws, you used to say when I read the story and written after the story.What is the lesson from this story, then after a short break, the verses come in that this quirky word is of great importance because it is the most important of the universal.The present Ummah, for example, as much as you have read, remember the verse that it may be that it may be that a Ummah is a Muslim.It has been a great reward for Allah.It is a great reward.The moment is the Muslim Ummah that we are not in this ponation today.I have heard you in the hadeeth.Secondly, it was a similar universal Truth.The last which we are the mountain of the Muslim Ummah can be so hard that their hearts can be so hard that the rocks and the rocks are in front of us.One of the possibilities is, however, let me know that the whole Ummah does not impose equal in this context.In this case, the leaders of the Ummah and the leaders of the Ummah are the scholars of it.Most of the most striking, this error falls into the back, because the rest of the people are followed by those who follow them.People are distorted in the Book of Allah, tell them what we are doing.Those who are trying to recognize the truth, tell them what we are doing.Obviously, the Muslims expected that the machinists were very bored.There was no concept of infidelity away from religion, they did not have the book.What is happening is a great destruction of the Eomenolism.You want you to say, "We hope that you will accept it, you will accept it.He has been distorted after he understood it and also distorted him.Now, obviously he became the scholars.يُحَلْوِفُونَهُ مِنْ مَا Amana now looks like a strange thing that the hypocrites were in the Jews as the hypocrites were in the Jews.It was not possible for some of the Jews to leave their business to their tribe, and the rule of the tribes was with their scholars, when they were talking to them, when they were talking to them, they were talking to them.It was now after that when they used to go to their devils, their devils, their scholars, their great people, they used to go and fool them.What are you doing?You tell them so that they can go to Allah and establish a hajj on you, because they knew them and they did not know them.When they are in solitude, they say to each other, "Do you say that you are telling them that the things that Allah has opened to you?" It is not yet time for you to say that you are doing such a foolish time, so do not they know that Allah knows all that they hide and all that they reveal, even if they do not tell the Muslims, do not tell them what they have to do with the fact that they have come to know about them today.There is also a section of these illiterate people.They are very educated.After us, people say that the ignorant majority of today are the great majority of Muslims who are educated by the educated Muslims, adding that the majority of us are not well -educated.Now they will trust all the scholars.They will believe in their books.There are those who know these desires will open later.What are these wishes.We are Israelis.We are the beloved of Allah.We are in the Ummah.They are burned with their wishful thinking, knowledge is not with them.There are some devotees in the realm of the original and the ruin and the Well Well, which is the section of Hell, which itself is asyluming for the sake of the Hell, which is destructive to them.Summ Yuqulunnah Hadid -ul -An -Lillah and then say that it is from Allah, Laishtarwa Bahh -Samnana Qaliyil, so that it may be special, it is a great thing that is a matter of fact.He said, "This is the destiny of religion.It is just that it is Allah.Now, how much is the fact that they have said the right thing.How much of a bribe they have done, they do not change themselves.They do not change the Qur'an.اللّٰهِ لِيَشْتَوووا بِهِ سَمَنًا قَلِيلًا فَوَيْلُنْ لَهُمْ It is a ruin and ruin for them and for them, the whole thing they are doing is the whole of the tragedy and the destruction of religion for him, they are destroying them for themselves.Missusanna Naar -ul -A'iyah -e -Ba'adodud, he says, "We cannot miss the fire.Only a few days of counting, just to forget in the eyes of others that no one should object to Allah, we were being beaten in the fire and we were not able to forget them.وَقَالُ لَتَّ مَسْسَنَا فَلَيْ يُخْلِ فَلْوَهُ عَحْدًا that you believe that Allah will not against His covenant will not be against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or you are talking to Allah for whom you are talking to Allah.Not Bella Mann Qasb -Siyyyat now, now it is the most universal Truth that I said, Abdi facts are coming to the great truth.Why not Billa, who did not have a sin but when it did not come to a sin, when it came to a sin.He is also giving the benefit of one, and even the one who has come to the forefront of a sin, when he came to a sin, the sermon and his sermon surrounded him.Bella mana

post of giffa, if the resistance to the sin, if it goes on, then it does not even know that it does not even know that it is a Muslim.The faith is like that, which is just like a door that is just a little bit of a door.The rest of the house is hollowed out.Big Foundation is being arranged for widows, but business is a problem, Lindin is a lie.Fahi is deceitful.All is running.Al -Jinnah Fayyah -Sa'aldun -He is Paradise and they will abide in it forever.وَمِلْ وَالِذَينِ

(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).I will not be able to explain here some of your people from their homes now, otherwise I will not understand that when the Israelites under the leadership of Josha Ibn Noor began to conquer Palestine, and first Jerry was conquered when the city of Palestine was not once again.There were fountains of water.Twelve governments of water now appear The thing is, where there were twelve governments, they used to say that they used to have wars, then there were wars, then they used to attack one another and forced the people to run away, so it was their quality but then the gym went to the gym because they went to their slaves and they went to them.If you are made, we are now leaving the flies that we have been ordered to leave anyone who is your Israeli brother.This is the distinction that comes within the Muslim Ummah.It will come to the Universal Truth while we made a pledge that you will not shed your blood, nor will you be removed from your people from your graves.If you come out of them, you are also with the gourd and even with abuse, and if they come to you as a prisoner, then you give them to you and release them, but it is time that their removal was forbidden to you.Now you have read this incident.Wherever this behavior is done, Tamil will cover it wherever it is a book and a book and you do not believe in a part of our book and one does not believe in a punishment.Al -Azab should be punished in the severe punishment of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).There is no trait is a business community.Without what to do, this business does not run.For everyone, they go to the Taui for everyone.They also say, "We are our own.We also work.We work on the TV.You also know that some of them

matter of time.The life of the world is upon us.The most severe punishment of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), we deserve the mercy of Allah, the mercy of Allaah, which is his authority, but then see the threat of the threat.You are coming to Umrah every year, who is saying that it is less than halal, or it is forbidden to be haraam in the first row in the harem in the haram.Take the seat and give bribes to the conditions there, and they do not know that Allah will not be able to do so.Allah will not deceive your Imams and Aba and Qaba.And the Lord gave Moses the Book to Moses, and then we kept on sending the Messenger of Allah and then wearing the Messenger of Allah.There is a difference between the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).There is no chance to go into detail at this time, but these three couples are such words.Al -Azam is one of the believers and Islam is now a Muslim believer is the same city, but there is no city, there is some difference.The third prophet and the Messenger will also be the difference.Every Prophet is not the Messenger.Every Prophet is the Prophet.If Kataf al -Mu'adin is now a messenger, it is the difference.Allah's The decision is that I and my messengers will prevail whenever a nation has tried to kill a messenger.I wish I was killed in the way of Allah, then be killed in the way of Allah, but it is in the meaning of the Prophet, but it is the Messenger of Jesus, but it is the Messenger of Jesus.It has arrived and we have given Jesus a very clear problem, but as given to Jesus, but not given to the Prophet, it will be a matter of fact.It is not in his own power.It is the appearance of Allah and what happens to him.But your lives do not like your mind, you do not like to see you.You have not come.This is a

Masadqallah Mummahah, who has come to confirm what they have, I have confirmed the Qur'an on the one hand.It was that he used to pray for the last book and the last prophet and for the sake of conquest of Allaah.The prophecy is now known when there were battles among them and they were investigating, there were cowardly cowards, so whenever they used to fight, they used to say that you kill us now.What used to be said to Allah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that his prayers could be conquered by his saints and through it, because the people of Khazarj and Ashi had heard these prayers, which is why they heard the Hajj in the Hajj of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).He is the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), even before he believed that he believed that he had become the source of his salvation, and the knowledge that he had with him became the source of the knowledge that he had, and because of his pride, he remained so.فِي فَكَانُوا مِن قَبْلُ جَسْتَفْتِهُونَ عَلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَلَمَّا Allah's Messenger (۔) is the saint of Allah, so that the disbelievers are unaware of the disbelievers.Mann -e -Abbadah is very bad, which he has committed to promoting his lives, ie the real problem of the world, gives the real problem here, whatever the fourth of his status, he is not willing to sacrifice

Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty.From his grace, whom he wished, he was hopeful that he would be Israeli when prophecy remained with us for fourteen hundred years.Now, nature is the last few years.Now the last prophet has come.It is here that why this Rahmatullah has become on Fazl ibn Ismail, because of this, the words of the rebellion will return to the word of this rebellion.This is the reason for this disagreement.The main reason for this is the word of rebellion.There is a lot of powerful motives that are to dominate urd to dominate why I do not believe that this domination is also the meaning of rebellion.To exceed the limits, he has to exceed his limits that he did all the reason for this.If you are invisible, then it is invisible, ie, it is invisible to them, ie, the

that the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: What is the disbelief of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Qur'an does not believe in the Qur'an and they are disbelieved, though it is true, true, and that they have come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).If Allah has become here, then why have you been killing the prophets

us and it may seem strange to you, but it may be strange to you, but in his Makatim, Shaykh Ahmad al -Hamdullah wrote that a sect of the Shi'ites has been kind.There were similar resemblance to a tribute to another tribe, calling Gabriel's deceit, he was deceived.He was not for Allah.It was not for Muhammad.And from the discovery, then here he said, "O Prophet, who has become an enemy to say," Gabriel's view of Gabriel, Al -Kalbak, Allah has done so.He did not have the authority of Gabriel with the rule of Allah on his heart.Allah and His Messenger and His Messenger and His Messenger and His Messenger and His Messenger and His Messenger and His Messenger are another Gank Hole.There can be no disagreement with them.There can be no disagreement.If you have any enemies and His Messenger of Allah and His Messenger of Allah and His Messenger of Allah and His Messenger of Allah and His Messenger of Allah and His Messenger.Gabriel and Michael also declare from Allaah that Allah is the enemy of such unbelievers.They do not, but the same thing that is rebellious.The money that came from the words of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), the words of the Holy Qur'an, the words of the
