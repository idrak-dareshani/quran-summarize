Surah -ud -Dhar now see the Majmun from which the Surah Qiyam was over.The couple begins there.مِنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَقُنْ شَيْئِمْ مَسْبُورَ کیا انسان پر نہیں آیا تھا ایک وقت ایسا بھی اس دہر میں سے اس دمانے میں سے انسان لکلا ہے نا قُلْزُمِ حَسْتِسِ تُوْ اُبْرَاحِ مَعْنِنْدِهُ بَعْدِ تو There is also a great Sam of the Qulzum -Timm of Time.From this, we have come to the fore.It is not obvious that man does not like it.He should be mentioned.What is the mixed point now tell me what it may have understood before, when it was not known that the masters are coming from the Majlmand, the Obum is coming from the mother.Then the gathering of these two comes from the excess, and then we are passing it through different judgments and we are also aware of it.For the sake of examining, Fajalinah -Sumiyah Basiyar, then We made it, the one who heard it, the one who heard it, and then We gave it the path of the path within our spirit.We did not send it to the path of the path.We did not send it in the day.One of the days has given him a dishonesty.Not a thing has been given to him.He has given him the soul.We have prepared for the lives of the living and the unseen, whether it is unacceptable.There will be a fountain with whom he will sit on the edge of Allah, the servants of Allah and they will take the springs in whatever they want.In the soul, it is a nephew in the soul, but the one who is pursuing against the evil is the solution to our heart.There will be a lot of hardship There is a person who never smiles on his face.In exchange for these sugar, they will find them will be sitting on the sidewalk for the sidewalks for the sake of the silk and silk for the sake of being a paradise.In this, La Yarwana Fahea Shamsha Mulazam Harra will not see any hardship in it, no hardness, nor the segmentation of the bag.The shadows of Lah and the shadows of Him will be spread over them.And they will be warm on them.People who are their servants will take the silver and you will be made of glass or kaft that will be made of glass, but this glass will not be glass.Silver will be the ones that you can see.The jam in which the Millenn will have the suit of the suit will also be a fountain in Paradise, which is the name of Salisbila, Vietofu, Beldan, and he will stay on them in a warm time.Their boys, their boys, their servants who will see them as if they were always on their way to them.On the decades, wherever they see, they will see that the semi -sectarians are the semos and the great royalty that Allah has given them to those tribes will be on them.But it will be said and it will be said that it is the badness of your people.Do not hurry your Lord's decision, it comes to it and you will have to be very patient in the tension that is starting now.In all these tights, but you talk about the words of any sore and unhappy in the morning, when you say no to the name of the Lord.In one part of the night, Allah is the right thing for him and in one part of the night.Give the whole matter for five times.The whole matter was burning with Surah Muzamman.Later, when the system of prayer came five times, it was short, and he was not for everyone.He also said for the Holy Prophet.This is an extra son for you.For everyone else, it is a blessing.They are actually strongly loved by the world.They love that in Surah Almighty, they love this flawed life and leave their lives, which is a great day behind them.Changing the cheeky manifestation whenever you want to bring them and bring them to the area that the argument is that when the cloud is death, our body is like we will be given the same meaning that they will bring them to one of them, but we have created a nation with the other.There has been strengthening and changing the Sunnah as such and making it like this is a reminder that it is a reminder.May Allah be pleased with Allah.Whoever wishes to have the benefit of Jesusha, who wants to enter the Surah Al -Ba'ad -ul -Fitr.وَلْمَسَٰلَ حَسَا يَهَا وَهُوَ مُمِنٌ The person who made the Hereafter his end, and focused for him, and focused for him, and made it hard for him, and for him, and for him, and for him, and for him, and for him, and for him and for him.For this, he was desperate for him and for him, and for him, and for him, and for him, Allah created you, and Allah created you, and those who are your deeds, Allah will also create Allah.Kan -ul -Hakima -e -Zakr -e -Munni Yash -e -Faye Rahimat -e -Waalz -ul -Mu'minin 'La'ad -i -Azam -ul -A'l -Yimah, the unjust, has been very painful.May Allah Almighty Allah Almighty Allah Almighty celebrate the Lebanese.
