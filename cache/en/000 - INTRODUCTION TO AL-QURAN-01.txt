Translation of the Qur'an.There is a special reason for the arrows once in Lahore once in Lahore, once in Bellaan, and this year I am going to myself and despite my illness, and that by the grace of Allah, there was something that was born on the cable Tavi, and the Qur'an was translated from the Qur'an, but it was also written on the Qur'an.The recording of the recording should be improved, so I am praising this need to meet this need.If whatever age is now the level of age, Naamar Harnox, my memory, is not as decadent as the first was the Cross References, which is not as much as I ever had before, even though I had never had any of these words.Do I pray to Allah myself.You should also pray to Allah to fulfill this area and that Allah Almighty makes the message of the Holy Qur'an and a great deal of knowledge and wisdom in the whole world of humanity.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was revealed and thirdly that it is in full secure form, Bin na has no distortion nor has there been any division.It is at least three ingredients.That being the word of Allah is because you have the knowledge that the Tarab which was given to Moses was given in the form of stone plates in the form of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and that the Qur'an, which has happened on Muhammad al -Rasool (may Allah be pleased with him), is in a different case when the Holy Qur'an is the last of the Holy Qur'an.The Arabs are now given a few months' haul, so make the final decision to convert to Islam or not, because after that there will be no exception for East Arabs who will not convert to Islam.There is no opportunity now that it has an East that there is a Middle East.He wants such a big challenge that we are given.We should be given the opportunity to sit with you for a few days.Listening to Allah's word, what arguments are for you to do.It was going to him, O Prophet, if any of these Eastern people asks for refuge from you.In the same sesame, the problem is the problem.Tuck Afsburg is under it.What a great deal of the word.The word which is the attribute of Allaah and this is a major problem of knowledge, and a major complicated problem of the Word is that the Almighty and its attributes are the Lord.From the truth to Jeddah or the same person, this age is a very complex issue of the word of knowledge, but that it is a consensus decision of the devotees in two words.With the Almighty, it becomes clear from the issue that since it is the attribute of Allaah and we cannot say to the attributes that it is from the Almighty, they cannot even say that the part of its essence is something that is related to the Holy Qur'an, but the Holy Qur'an has mentioned it with the Qur'an.Is that greatness as it is full of greatness and which is not

my ideology has not been able to find any example of this, which I will not find any example of this.Do not consider this Qur'an as a book of Fash Boim Achille Pharkal Mazar -e -Nest.Risi also understands There is a person who talks about a few sentences when he promises, he will find out that his wisdom of his wisdom is Arabic and what his mind's level will be understood as if the word is doing the whole personality of the whole personality.In a few sentences, the promise will be made, so the types of cleansing of Allaah are also contained in this Qur'an, of which some of the things

of them.Of their brothers, they will be their brother and who are they?The Israelites you have just heard when the crores were on, and Clinton came and when Shah Hussein, who came to Jordan, came and became a burden, he was the Prime Minister of Israel, then President Clinton said that you are the cousins ​​of the cousins.But what shape my word will come down on it.
