Now we are coming back to Bucky Janbat, the last group is starting from here, the last scene started with Surah Qab.Here is the end of the group Bucky and Madani cases, seven Surahs, Hussein Talim Surahs of the Qur'an, they were the first seven Surahs, Surah Qab, Surah Zariyat, Surah, Surah Najam, Surah Tomb, Surah Rehman, Urs -ul -Quran, then Surah incident.Then these ten Surahs Agar Surah Hadith, Surah Majdala, Surah Hashir, Surah Mumtana, Surah Rafi, Surah Collection, Surah Malafqun, Surah Talabun, Surah Tala, Surah Distortion.Now this Bucky Qur'an, this is the last group, the first six Surahs in it are in the form of all three groups.Surah Bulk is big, as the Sura Koff was there, there is a Surah Malik here, very comprehensive, its effectiveness and it was very dear to the Holy Prophet.You used to read Surah Malik while sleeping at night and you have done it.Allah Rehman -ur -Rahim Tabarak al -Zaib or Dahl Malik Wahu Ala Kul Shahi near the royal, big Babar says that the king of the king is in his hands, this is the political aspect of religion.The whole universe is running night, there is a rebellion in the world, why?He wants to take the contenders of his faith, that's it.Moula Surat, Chang, Galaxy, the entire universe and a jewel of our body itself is subject to its law.Where is our body in our power?I get fed up with two days.From here, it is only when I take time.If I want to come here, I have a body, I do not have the option, they will come.So our body also knows that his physiological is concerned, his inconvenience is concerned, the loser of Allah is not subject to me.I want my heart to cry, it will not happen whenever I want it, it will not happen, when it is closed, it is not in my power.But in what we have our optional life, we have done so that we will not believe in Allah, obey our own, obey themselves, believe in our wives.And whatever the purpose is, they will be interested in, chased, work their work, we will win the bulls within their ranks so that we can be luxurious, the world is placed for us, our luxury may Allah.But this is actually the test, the Pak royal is still here, it is just a grant of Hulzi, we should sit as a grant, my will, my idea, my view, my view is and what is near us, our culture, the ideal system we have created, we have to protect it.Tubarak -ul -Bada -ul -Mulk -ul -Wahoo Ali is probably close, he is worth the same thing, the Almighty creation, Lamlo Akam Akum, a kind, now see that we have considered the human being so far, which Omar, which is a great sair, he has said to his wife and has said that he is a Bayat -e -Basin, Basan, Hadith, Hadith, Hadith.Life was then death again, what kind of hadeeth and myths?Of course, we also saw the first cantam Mabatan, the inferior understanding of the lesser you understand, why should this break?Why this death break, a part of life was removed, thirty, four, fifty, sixty years, this world life, then death interval, death is a life break, ie, with the end of the end, why?Tell her wisdom, what we In the Surah incident taught, appreciation is the continuation of Bankam Almut, your life in which we have put a break from death, why?Creator Almut -ul -Waliyyat Labelo Akam Akam Ekam Staff, It is the case that you have tried to be a test, test, you should be examined, it was a three -hour test that you ever think in schools, now they think thirty years, and it is really thirty years after the first age, then it is a special age, and then it is a special age.Take, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, let's take, let's take, let's take, take it, take it, take it, take it, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take, let's take.Take the qal -i -Zam -e -Zam -e -Husseat -e -Sutawa Abir -e -Mannanid -Habab -like a balloon in the sea.Life is the life of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).فِي You will not see that the creation of Allah is such a good system in the creation of Allah, so far in the creation of a scientist, there is no flaw in Zuloji or in the Fail of Zulhoji, in the Fail of Zulhoji or in the Fail of the Fail, in the Fail of Zulhoji.How I have said in the failure of the Fail that you have said, 'Look back in every field, if you see this system in every field, if you see this system, then look back in every field.Who is his creator, his ambassador simply does not see Saheedan seeing everything.The parsley of the stars of the stars could travel to the world of their thoughts.Somewhere there is no cracks and we have decorated the nearest heaven, the first heaven from the earth, the first heaven and we have made them.We have made the Razomal Devil devils who try to get out of what they try and they want some of the news that they are ready for them.The punishment of the healing is done by those who disbelieve the Lord of Allah, whether it is a human being, whether giants.For them, the punishment of Hell Hell is the punishment of Hell and it is a great deal.If a hunting web is in front of him, the way he will come to it will be near to Tawizu Mann al -Ghaith, so that he will explode from his or her.They will say, "Why did you not warn you?" It has come to an end or something has come to an end, or they said, "If we listened and thought, we would not have worked wisely, we would not have been in this hell.We acknowledged our true sin.This is a very important place.We did not listen to it.We did not listen to it and we did not listen to it.Allah has given you this inquiry, so that we have become the sand of our community.That is not to think or listen to the Sunnah, the real sin is that they should be seized by their fishermen.There is forgiveness for them, and there is also a great deal of forgiveness for them, and see if you hide your words by hiding your words or speaking loudly.He is also aware of the one who is in your breasts and is there.You know what poses are putting in it.Has made the land for you.The ruling command is left in your lips.If you want to live in it, you want to make money, Fimshu Faye Binna Faye Bhu Bhu Bhu Bhua Chhova says that it is also a great sensation of his shoulders, as if the cheeky was walking with the gentleman of a mystery.What we consider to be very Messiah is nothing.He should not shake you into the earth, but he will not be able to shake, when he is shaking, and you go.Do you have no lyrics that Allah Almighty will send to you to you, a clash in which the stones were coming to know that it was a bit of a blow to you, and then you would know how to do it.They were already bowing down, so how did I catch me and do my punishment.They do not see the birds who are on them, they have spread it on their own.Who is the one who becomes your army and your bulk, in the case of the Most Merciful, the Al -Qa'afirun -ul -Qafirun -ul -Qafirun -ul -Qafirun -ul -Qafirun is not in peace.Who is then who can take you a path if Allah stops the Divine teachings of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).There are people who are living on the Hunger -Susta only because of instincts.Paul Mahisi Jeddah, who is alive for him, is in the same way that he has no idea where to go ahead.This is exactly the philosophy that has come in Surah Hajj.Man is in fact the same person who has set any of his own nobles in an adale life without any purpose in life.Jablings are just the lamps of dignity.Man is not just a havan.There is something else in it and there is no adele for him as much as it will be.The human being will go, but the one who has no edel at the end is the nourishment.The path and its destination is the same.There is a person who has made you insha'Allah's inspiration, and has given you his eyes and gives you hearts or gives you hearts or giving you hearts, and why you know that you know the first generation of human knowledge, and when you have the first generation of knowledge, you know the first generation of human knowledge.You hear from Samas, lecturing in the cross is giving Professor lectures.What has happened before you have collected the information you have come from the previous generations.Now you have got some other information.قُلْ لُوْلَاَقَتْ عَلَانُ مَسُولَ قُلَمَّا تَشْكُرُونَ The form of a very ever that you do, the qal -halo -luzi َ r َ k َ k ُ m ْ فِلْلَوْدِ مِلَهُ مِلَهُ مََََََََََََََََ Will be collected will be collected.The knowledge of this is the knowledge of وَإِنَّمَ عَنَ النَذِيرٌ مُبِينٌ And I am a clear and clear gift to the Bashan.There is no responsibility for me.They will also fight the habits of their faces.Their faces will be evil.Tell me my Lord, if my Lord destroys me and destroy me with Allah, if my Lord destroys me and kill me with Allah, and Allah Almighty Allah Almighty.Almighty Allah has mercy.Success success is the greatest success and it would be successful, but you will say that you will be successful, that is, you think who will save the capable, not clearly from the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Thinking are the case where Surah is in the early days, it is now known that it is the first time, whose last thanks are those who are Surah Anam and Surah Araf and Surah Yunus and Surah Hohn.I have seen we have seen you will know who was in the Gulf of error, or you were qal -e -Tamnah -e -Tammah -e -Ba'amah, if you were on the earth and once again, if you were in the earth, if you were in the earth.They go down.Sometimes the tail is very alarmed that the surface of the water is going down.The rain is down.The water level is going down.Where will the water go down.لَهُ لِي وَلَكُمْ
