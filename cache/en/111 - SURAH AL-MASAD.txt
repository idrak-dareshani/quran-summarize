Bismillah al -Rahman al -Rahim al -Rahim Tambabat Yadababi Lahabbam Waitba is the case of the early days, the broken hands of the Holy Prophet and the merciful and he has become herself.The fact is that when the verse we have read to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) in Surah Hajar, Fasdah Bumat-ul-Umar, the first 3-4 years of three years, you have invited the people whom we will say was never underground, so it was wrong to use the word.In the conversations you were offering your invitation, then the order came.Even whatever it can also, too, too, even too, even also also gathered us for this work, too.The method you adopted was that there was a general declaration that an army came to know that an army was going to be attacked, so the person who did not have the news to come down the clothes and stood at a hurricane of the mother -in -law, who came to the fore.There were no people who were standing on the good of the nakedness.What is the news?He did not have any question of being naked by the Holy Prophet, but you took half the matter who has no compulsion that you standing up to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).Laughing, even though the Hour is the Hour of Resurrection.He said, "You have broken your hands.You have called for this task." The thing is, but in reality the unseen have been cut off in the universe, and then it has become exchanged.I was also included in the name.He was a very beautiful woman and both of them who thought that there was a great elite class.This society had the position of God.It was a godly God, so it was known about it that he had stolen gold made of gold.He was morally infamous, but that was the great place of the Haram as he was in it.In such a burning fire, we will bend it.Why was it an enemy to his wife and his wife, as much as Abu Lahb was an enemy, but it is difficult to say that the wife was more enemy or that the city was more enemy and I told you that the best of the women was in Surah Al -Wahir.One of Hazrat Noor and wife Hazrat Lod, who was a good system, and in the lap of the Prophet, Maryam Salam and this clergyman and the wife of the Bater and the wife of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), who would be lifting the blind, generally thinking that they were a great lady.Movement is bringing it blind to the clock of its city's fire and to incite it.The pearls that are defeated in its sidewalk are in fact the rope on which the rope on which it will now be brought to the darkness of the Hereafter, and the city will be burned with it and the city will be burning with it.The necklace of the Huttabat -e -Hashid -e -Masjid will become its rope in the darkness of his sidewalk.It will become his rope.
