Surat al -Qariya, this is the style of affiliation Bismillah -ur -Rehman -ur -Rahman al -Qariya, the Al -Qariya and the Al -Qariya, the standing of the Al -Qariya, what is he standing?The Qur'an says that no one has heard of the door to open the door at the door, the Qur'an is the Qur'an that when it comes to the Day of Resurrection, the whole world will stand up.The day when human beings are as if they are kites, the scattered veterans will become as if the mountains and the mountains will become as if they are the first to be the foolishness of the people of the world.I have two shapes.There is a nasal scapen.The scales that have two pulls have one sprouting balance.Inside it, whatever the springs inside it, it tells them how much it weighs.And there will also be a person's demeanor, if he has his own genes, his own genes, whatever his own contracts were, despite all the concessions of his own agreement, he will be pleased with the desired amount of life, which will be pleased with his own life.What is the life of his life will be on happiness, which is the blood of good deeds, which is light, his abode is a pit and you know what a pit is a fire, whether it is a fire or a majer or a majer or a majir baraka Allah, but the Holy Qur'an is the Almighty and the Holy Qur'an.
