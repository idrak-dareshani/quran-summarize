Praise be to Allaah.The mention of the pilgrimage of the Hajj of Rafis and La Faswak and La Jadal -ul -Hajj and Ma'am -e -Tahir -e -Tahir -ul -Hajj, and Tazudo Fun Khair al -Zadz -ul -Tawi, and the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) had begun to mention the pilgrimage of the Hajj, and in this regard, if any of the pilgrims started their pilgrimage or praying, they should perform such pilgrimage.It is said that the rules of the Hajj in this Surah without performing Umrah without having to open the ihram and without performing Hajj.It is a matter of fact that Fahinana al -Hijjah, who is obliged by Allaah, then whoever obliges himself to make Hajj in these months refers to the intention of strengthening the intention, and the sign of strengthening the intention is that the person who has come to Hajj, who is obliged to perform Hajj.The first of these is the imprisonment, which is not a matter of humiliation.Be it school and even today, it is one of the inventors in the world.It does not see such a large number of people and there is peace.There is no appreciation of war and conflict and conflict and mischief, or that there are any politically raised campaigns in the back days, or that there is no other thing to do with it.You have done it during this.Allah will know that you are reading Nawafl.You are doing extra tawaaf and even if you are doing it, there is no need to show anyone else.With their silence, human beings should earn whatever they are able to earn any more derogatory pilgrimage.The path is taken in the form of expenditure, then what will happen, they will take good ihraam to spend only money, take a good place, if the piety is not, then it will not be the hajj, but it is very important that it is very important that if a person does not take his own path here, then it is better for him to take it here.Don't stand in front If you are not able to do so, then you do not have a duty to the dream that you do not have the duty of you, begging there or begging here or taking a donation.This is the wrong thing.Al -Ba'ab, and of course, piety me.Fear me, O Hashmandu Lisa Alaikum Jalil, then there is no harm in you.It is not a sin.It is not a sin that you seek the grace of your Lord as a journey of the Hajj.Man is leaving India from Pakistan when you get any good money from you to trade there.Cell then when you return from Arafat, because the original pilgrimage is Arafah.Note the timetable that the timetable is actually leaving Mecca on the evening of 8, and the night is 9, then the day is 9 days.Before entering Arafat, which is the mosque, which is not included in the alias from the Arafat, it is beyond its limits, so it is better to read the influence and the influence there and after that there is a sunset.It is the establishment of Arafat.If the prayers have been achieved, then they have been praying.This is the prayer of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).This is the establishment of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) after the time of the west prayer, but there is no permission to pray in the West, but now go and gather the West and the Holy One.You did not know that the Hajj was left out of the Hajj, and that the spirit of Hajj was over.In this regard, you have changed the way they have come forward, and they are on the brink of all.The people coming from the outside will go from Arafat and return from Arafat.All this is not for us.We are Makkah and our glory is that we will not go to Arafat.Ask Allah Almighty Allah, ask Allah Almighty Allah.The stories of the verses are being narrated as we have the rogue people.Now, mention Allah with fury, are among the people who say, "O Lord, give us the world, there is no share in the Hereafter for such people.All the prayers and their worlds are also for things.For the sake of the children, for the sake of the children, they are the only things in their hearts.The child was given the destiny of the child and love is like the love of the world in our hearts.There is no share in the Hereafter for the Hereafter, and they are the ones who say that Rabbana Atna Fi -ud -Diniyah Husseinata Wafi al -Akhinat -Husnat -Waqnah -e -Azab -ul -A'zab al -Nahnar and Grant of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Save the good of the world from your share.Whatever happens to the Ricky Yamani to every cycle, it is a part of the prayer that is prayed for from the Yamani to the Hajar Uthmat.There is no shortage of mistakes within any of my actions, so do not think that whatever has been done, it will be a must for what they have earned in it.It is sincere in it.It is well -versed in it.All those who have its etiquette and conditions are not pleased with Allah.It will be calculated soon.It would seem that the word has come back here to explain what I woke up to explain that the fasting of the fasting of the fasting was three days because the word of the material came here.If anyone who returns quickly in two days, it is not completed for three days.In two days, he would have no sin on him, then there is no sin on him.The day he started living any other movements, it is tired and what is inside the tabit is not stone, then it will not be useful to him for the third day, but that is the real honey which is the condition of Allah, for acceptance.Take the piety of Allah and the piety of Allah, and keep it in your mind that you will be gathered to Him, all of you will be taken to Him.Whatever a group, it was mentioned to a hypocrite that the hypocrisy of those who were common was clearly visible and a kind of hypocrisy was made to the big los, the fat language, the fat language, that they are very sincere and are very virtuous, and they are very thankful to them, but their language is related to them.That is, their role is very bad and then when they go back to talk or after making talk, what their role is based on mischief, and they are like that.In the life of the world, they are also witnesses to Allah.Khusam comes to the enemy when he goes back and forth.Now, he who removes the bar in the dimension, causes him to mislead him and burns his cultivation.Someone who has an animal who has been killed.Allah Almighty does not like mischief when you are afraid of Allah.If his self -esteem is falsely honored and fastened, a person who has made a mistake has made his mistake, so he will make his mistake.One is the one who believes in my mistake, his false ego, and who is his false honor, gives him the honor and sin of sin.It is enough for him to hell now and he is very bad.It is his role, but it is as if it is true in terms of glory, and that it is also a role in Tawil, but it is also the character.This character will be played everywhere.In fact, he should recognize the character and ask Allaah to seek his guidance from Him in this regard.For the pleasure of the pleasure of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).وَلَّهُ رَعُوفٌ بِالْعِبَاتِ And Allah is very kind to His servants, obviously, who has intended and intended, such a person may have any evidence.صلاتِ وَنُصْكِ وَمَحْجَایَ وَمَمَاتِ لِللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ پھر یہ ہے کہ کوئی تیس دورے گا کوئی آجتا چل سکے گا مختلف صلاحیتوں کے لوگ ہوتے ہیں اس میں فرق و تفاوط رہے گا لیکن جس نے یہ عظم کر لیا ہے اللہ تعالی اُن کے حق میں بہت شفید ہے یا ایوہ اللَّهِ نَا The whole of the whole of the believers enters Islam, saying that it is now being said in reverse or Connor, Israel, in what we have read to Israel, Of our Book of Books.You believe in a part of our law and make a quote.There is no point in any of the words of Allah, whoever of you, will be humiliated in the world, and on the Day of Resurrection, he has come to the fore.He is now saying that Muslims do not mean that there is no meaning of Allah.No, but this is not the command.I can mean that one is the negation of the one who will be negative tomorrow.This is a nail.It cannot be partial.فَلَمُوا انَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزُ الْحَكِينَ So know that Allaah is again emerald.Then what happened to this man, then what is the question of Jinn and the two, then what is the question of the two and the two who taught the belt to the human being, the part of the religion that is comfortable, the one who is sitting on the week and the bitterness is that the second strip teaches that it is right that it is Allah's command.It is also a requirement of the responsibilities of the children.Will it be when the clock will come, this time and the Ummah can end suddenly when the resurrection of the sack will come suddenly when it comes to suddenly, and every person's dancing resurrection hangs like a sword on his head.What may be the lesser thing that may have suddenly ended by Allah, the stooping of the stop, now that you have written, now you have no longer ahead of you.He said that Litta'aba'a Sunnah Minnah Minnah Qiblalikmim will be obliged to do and he wills to his traces, but the blessing of the person who has come to him, he changes his distortion, or after his blessings, he is blessed with him.So know that Allah is hard to give it again.His example is that he has said two published, but he was asked and this suburbs will come back again.In Surah Al -Imran, the life of the world is great for the disbelievers.Their eyes have gone well.All things do not like to do, but in the hearts of the people, their love is so much growing that then there is no good thing in their rights, nor does any good affect the believers if they receive blessings with faith.It has been made in the hadeeth that the world has come to mind.التَّقَعُونَ وَالَّذِينَ التَّقَعُونَ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ And those who on the Day of Resurrection will now be upon them, and in the Surah Mutfin, we will know the habit of the believers.Yarzaqq -Min -Yash -e -Yash -e -Baghir -e -Husbah and Allaah will say that without whom He wills, it is a sign of Paradise.Now this is a verse coming from which I have welcomed the Most Holy One, the Most Holy Prophet and the Holy One of the Wisdom and the Wise.They have been made in this burden.The two wives of the two, the Shari'ah and the affairs of the two wives, the information and the jihad Jihad Balal Jihad Balanfis, and these flowers come to them.Part is wrong.What is wrong, what is wrong.He will be aware of this verse.There is no doubt that man was all one of the people.If a son was Habel, then the other was Cain, then Allah started sending the prophets who used to give good news to the righteous and those who were aware of the cars and Allah, with them, told them the book with them so that they did not agree with the people who disagreed with them.The direction was given and the reason I wanted to note this word before I had already made a note.Why do I believe in what happens in the whole world of corruption in the world?In the middle of the conflict of truth and inwardness, the plunge of truth and inwardness in the innermost human being runs in the innermost man.Then he said, "We started sending our messengers.الَّذِينَ مَرُوا لِبَخْتَلَفُوا فِي مِنَ الْحَقِِّ بِإِذْنِ So now Allah Almighty instructed those who believed about the things in which they had disagreed, by His command, Allah gave them the guidance of faith.Allah Almighty and Allah guides whom He wills to the straight path, but his second translation will also be that Allah guides what He wants to be the guidance of Allah, and whoever seeks guidance is the Lord of Allah.He has considered it a responsibility to give him a guidance that he will seek in our way.We will want to move towards the truth.We will guide them.We will guide them towards their paths.Allah has taken His responsibility.Now Haseeb is coming to you with a very hard verse.Half of the people were not such a problem.It was not difficult.They were not there.They were not there.I have been lacking by those who have been lacking.He was severely hungry for hunger, and they were shocked, even though they were killed, even though they were the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah, who would be the Messenger of Allah.Bad, Nasrullah, near or now, is given the good news to be aware that Allah's evil is near, that is, Allah tests.This is the thing that has already been today and the money is.In the beginning we will try it.It is not a flower way.There is no flow of flowers.Lazid Akhlo Mann Before the Mustam Al -Basao Wazalo, Yakul Rasul -Wal -e -Amanu Treaty, Nasrullah Al -Nasrullah Al -Nasrullah, this verse was told to the Muslims in Surah Al -Rafi, while the Ghazwa -e -Azam was a great testimony and the best of his testimonial tests was done.It

training.This word of Qutbba has arrived: The ruling of the Qur'an came to the Qur'an, in the same way that the Qur'an is obligatory, the Qur'an is the Qutbat -ul -A'l -Yakam -ul -Qutt -ul -Wa'akir -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -wa -o -o -o - It may be that you dislike something, and that you may be good for you, that you may be good for you.Do not believe in your minor.You believe in the revelation of Allah.Believe in the Messenger of Allah.For the time when the commandment was present, the commandment was made for fourteen years.Now when the command of war began, now they used to ask that the month of Hajj is of Umrah, so how can I have to fight in this time, so that it is time to say that it is time to say that it is time for war.In the event of the Nakhla, a competition that they had to do was forced to do the noise.Look, what is the situation of these people, and they are the ones who are the Hereafter of the Messenger of Allah, and they have divided them for the month of Haram.In the months of the month, the command of the murder is a great thing to fight in the month of forbidden month.This disbelief is also the right sin of Allah.Fitna is the capability in which it is difficult for the faith to remain in faith and practice Islam.Today's whole society is Fatna.It is difficult to practice Islam.And these are the conditions and it is and these things are zi and the paths of adultery are open Go within a society that will not be possible to follow the truth when dominance is false.In a society where it is not possible to follow the truth, it is the greatest temptation that is dominated by falsehood.You will be indicated here with your heart to the Bashkir goat because now it is going to you, Surah Al -Baqarah is going to be a ghazu for Badr.مَنْدِيرِكُمْ ف ۔مَيَّرْ تَذِبْ مِنْكُ مَنْدِيرِكُمْ and Sullal -joo have also turned away from you.Habit -ul -Umal -ul -Faye -ud -Diniyyah wala -khakhar, then they will be the ones

(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are the Ghafoor and the merciful.Now, see the Salula's Lulkumar -e -Walbis.The aspect of a great sin is that there is also a uniqueness for the people and for the people, and that the aspect of sin is greater than the side of the disgrace, it is a matter of fact.But in the order of the order, it is just that there are some benefits.They are Ghadi Bashad.Some Russia also needed a day, and I said that the journey was very long from the path.Does not be ready to pay a fee, I want to see both of them and do not want to see both.If I want to be a festival, I want a day, and Joh is also a negative of the chance, claiming that a man is bowing down.Earning on the chance to earn from the claim is also the negation of the Mahant, so the two are actually the same day and they ask how much letters.Do not put the needs behind the needs, then fulfill your needs.Now, now you think that in a commission that is Flosis, a surplus value is a surplus value.It is the surplus value that is more than you need.The only thing in this is how much of Allah's needs is, it does not determine any measure.This is the inner soul whose love of Allah and the faith of the Hereafter will increase.He will reduce his needs.He will back his life and give him more and more in the way of Allah.You think, consider you the end of the world.It should be about the world of the world.How much value is the value of the Hereafter, if the allocation is not on the basis of it, then if the sensation and the propaganda is gone, it is the opinion that everything will be filled with something.There was something less in a medicine prescription.You have reduced the less you had come and it may not be a source of it.Something about the orphans of the orphans to say to Allah Almighty, to keep in mind that they have seen what is better.In fact, the verse of Surah ibn Asrai is in front of the people.Why can it be that in your wealth, why can they go to your stomach to go to your stomach?Now it is obvious that the orphan is also eating.You have food.For the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it was such that the Shari'ah became

you swear by the doors of your goodness?Trying that you are not obeyed.So in fact it is not their time to swear at this time, but it is a matter of what we call them.They have a style of dialogue.There is no point in the conversation.Yes, you have intended with your heart that you have sworn, then it will be influenced by it.And the real things that are the whole commandments they will come again.Some sixteen are sixteen.Some sixteen maids are Ghafoor Rahimullah Ghafoor.The Holy Prophet was also called Ella.When they had made a lot of interest that now the common Muslims have

the right of the man.In fact, the welfare of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the rights for those who are on the basis of their responsibilities and their responsibilities, which are on the basis of their responsibilities and men.One of the rights of the rights is Allah Ezid al -Hijim and Allah is Embar and the Wise.In Islamic Shariah, there is no between the city and the woman between the men and the women.On the occasion of the Corpsing Taking the propaganda is also given the right to what is the right and where will the wives come from when they say and men have a position on them.Now you like it and you do not like it.
